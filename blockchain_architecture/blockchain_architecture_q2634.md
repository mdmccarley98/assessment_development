## Stem
Efficient communication between miners, validators, and users can be challenging unless attention is given to how routing protocols identify autonomous networks and establish communication channels between them. Cross-chain gateway protocols establish those communication channels, including the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). What are the main four factors BGP uses to establish a route?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Router Identification, Origin Type, Path Length, and Neighbor IP Addresses.

## Distractors
### 1.
Recognized routers in route, Route Costs, Nearby Device Network Addresses, and Origin Type

### 2.
Network Entity Type, Network Service Access Priority, Path Length, and Router Identification

### 3.
Router Costs, Origin Type, Path Length, and Number of Hops

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That the Internet is controlled by only one router protocol and all routers are configured using that one protocol.
