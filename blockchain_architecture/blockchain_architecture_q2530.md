## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: Delegates are users in a DPoS system who oversee governance within the blockchain. Delegates are voted in by other users. A delegate can propose altering the size of a single block or changing how many witnesses are paid for validating blocks. When changes are proposed by a delegate, the users within the blockchain vote on adopting these changes.
