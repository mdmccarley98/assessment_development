Multiple Choice

## Stem
When is the Blockchain Data Availability problem relevant?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Very large size blocks, sharding, and rollups

## Distractors
### 1.
Variable size blocks, Layer 2 applications, and Proof of Stake

### 2.
Light clients, sharding, and randomly selected validators

### 3.
Large Merkle trees, rollups, and light clients

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions:  Most blockchain implementations have different types of nodes.  Not all nodes keep the entire mainnet locally because that doesnâ€™t scale well when the number of nodes or the size of blocks increases substantially.  There is no current solution to this problem in a monolithic architecture.
