## Stem
Why is the last block of a Public Blockchain not considered “Final” even if it was added several days ago?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
A hash of the last block has not been created, validated, and added to the blockchain to ensure data immutability.

## Distractors
### 1.
The timestamp and Merkle root are not validated until another block has been added.

### 2.
The last block is not “Final” until the hash in the block that precedes it has been modified to validate it.

### 3.
The Nonce in the last block has not been updated to allow the processing of another block to begin.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That adding a block to the blockchain ensures that the data is accurate, secure, and all the transactions it contains are fully validated.
