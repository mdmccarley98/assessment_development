## Stem
If a blockchain wallet is lost or becomes inoperable, the owner has to recover the wallet to retain access and ownership of the assets stored in the wallet. Which of the following is a FALSE statement about wallet recovery?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Seed phrases are created from words carefully chosen from the online Oxford dictionary. Seed phrases can be 12 – 24 words long. The words are selected randomly.

## Distractors
### 1.
The seed phrase is required to restore a wallet. Without the seed phrase, the owner will not be able to restore the wallet. The owner will never be able to get ownership of the assets back.

### 2.
Cracking seed phrases and passphrases for private keys is virtually impossible. State-of-the-art encryption is used to create private keys and seed phrases, making the possibility that hackers can crack them extremely low.

### 3.
The seed phrase provides access to the whole wallet. It is the access key for all the assets controlled by the wallet. The passphrase for a private key provides access to just one user address (crypto account).

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That wallets are a single point of failure, and that if one fails all of the data it contains is lost. This is not the case. A wallet isn’t a new piece of hardware. It’s a logical device that can take on many different physical forms. The entire data structure of a wallet can be recreated if it is backed up properly and the “seed phrase” are maintained separately.
