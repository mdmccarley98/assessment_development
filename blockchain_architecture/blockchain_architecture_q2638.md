## Stem
Ciphertext feedback is one type of cipher block chaining that makes encrypted data more secure in block ciphers. What is the most severe disadvantage when cipher block chaining is implemented in blockchain technology?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The cipher from the previous block is required to compute the next encrypted block; therefore, parallel encryption is not possible.

## Distractors
### 1.
Cipher block chaining does not provide an efficient authentication method.

### 2.
The resistance to native cryptanalysis is reduced by cipher block chaining; therefore, some other process to strengthen cryptanalysis resistance must also be implemented.

### 3.
There is a potential for data loss due to using a shift register during the cipher block chaining process.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information: 
Common misconceptions: That all forms of cipher block chaining are interchangeable.
