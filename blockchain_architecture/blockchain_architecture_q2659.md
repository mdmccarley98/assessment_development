Multiple Choice

## Stem
Proof of Quality is a blockchain proof implemented for use in supply chains. Supply chain systems are usually implemented as private permissioned blockchains rather than public blockchains where anyone can be a miner, validator, or user. Which of the following are features of Proof of Quality consensus systems that set them apart from public blockchain systems?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Proof of Quality provides fraud protection at the lot, shipment, or order level, even when the users are connected using ad hoc systems that do not have continuous connectivity.

## Distractors
### 1.
Proof of Quality provides fraud protection at the lot, shipment, and order level, because users have verified connections throughout the supply chain tracking and shipment process.

### 2.
Proof of Quality provides a projection of future quality at the lot, shipment, and order level. It calculates the quality level of all past performances to determine the quality of the next product shipment.

### 3.
Proof of Quality provides a projection of future quality at the lot, shipment, and order level, but it must be used with at least one other blockchain proof with math-metric components.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That all blockchain proofs are referenced in the present and depend on things that have occurred in the present or have just occurred in the past. There are proofs that rely on the aggregate collection of data from the past to decide about the present and the future.
