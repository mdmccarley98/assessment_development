## Stem
Ethereum (ETH) was designed to use a Proof of Work mining consensus method. Ethereum2 (ETH2) was designed to use a Proof of Stake staking consensus method. ETH is being merged into ETH2.
<br><br>
Which of the following accurately describes the initial merger process for tokens from ETH to ETH2?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Mining will no longer be used; chain sharding and withdrawing staked ETH will not be possible until a future upgrade.

## Distractors
### 1.
Chain sharding will be implemented, ETH staked during the transition period will be immediately returned to its owners, and mining will no longer be used.

### 2.
Chain sharding will be implemented, ETH staked during the transition period will be immediately returned to its owners, and all existing ETH will be converted to ETH2 at an exchange rate of 1.25ETH to 1ETH2.

### 3.
Mining will no longer be used, chain sharding will be implemented, and withdrawing staked ETH will not be possible until a future upgrade.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That blockchain governance decisions result in changes the governance tokens when the consensus method is changed.
