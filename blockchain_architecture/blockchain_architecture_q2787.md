## Stem
Blockchains depend upon the integrity of hashes. A hash is stored in each block added to the blockchain representing the data in the previous block. If a block has been corrupted or fraudulently modified, the hash in the next block will not validate its data. Suppose a catastrophic failure occurred, and most of the decentralized copies of a blockchain were lost or destroyed. What minimum number of copies must survive to ensure the integrity of the entire blockchain?

### 2.
3

### 3.
Zero; the blockchain can be reconstituted from metadata maintained by miners.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: If only one copy remains the holder can modify data before distributing versions to other participants for decentralization. At least two copies that can be compared are required, but that depends on there being no collusion between the two parties. Two trustworthy parties is the minimum.
