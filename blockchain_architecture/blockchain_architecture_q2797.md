## Stem
Blockchain forks can be categorized as accidental or intentional. Many blockchain implementations' design specifications, code, and documentation are stored in public data repositories. Developers can use them to create their own identical copy of an existing blockchain or create a new implementation by modifying the code.
<br><br>
If a new team of developers copied Bitcoin's code to implement a new blockchain as a hard fork, what impact would that hard fork system have on the operation of Bitcoin?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
It would have no impact.

## Distractors
### 1.
The forked blockchain system would merge with Bitcoin when the system was operational.

### 2.
The validators from the forked blockchain system would also become validators for Bitcoin.

### 3.
The forked blockchain system's miners would also become miners for Bitcoin.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: Forks are not always a bad implementation decision. Many applications can be created with reduced effort by using the public code from an existing blockchain and forking it with application specific updates.
