## Stem
Ethereum (ETH) was designed to use a Proof of Work mining consensus method. Ethereum2 (ETH2) was designed to use a Proof of Stake staking consensus method. ETH is being merged into ETH2.
<br><br>
Which of the following accurately describes the merger process for Smart Contracts?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
ETH2 will be able to run Smart Contracts without modification from the history and state of ETH.

## Distractors
### 1.
ETH2 will be able to run Smart Contracts with minor modifications to resolve the prior history and the state of ETH.

### 2.
ETH2 will require significant modifications to some Smart Contracts that rely on ETH's prior history and state.

### 3.
ETH2 will require modifications to all Smart Contracts carried forward from the prior history and the state of ETH.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That blockchain governance decisions result in changes to the execution of Smart Contracts and other embedded code used in the operation and management of the blockchain.
