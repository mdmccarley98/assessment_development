## Stem
Why does SHA-3 have more cryptographic strength than SHA-256?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
SHA-3 uses the “Keccak” hash family of algorithms, employing “sponge construction” to generate the hash.

## Distractors
### 1.
SHA-3 uses the “Mini-Mine” hash family of algorithms, which employs “hash feedback construction” to generate the hash.

### 2.
SHA-3 is only considered more secure than SHA-256 because SHA-3 produces a 1024-bit hash and SHA-256 produces a 256-bit hash.

### 3.
SHA-3 is an encryption function and a one-way hash function which makes it more secure than SHA-256.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
SHA-3 is a more secure hash primarily because the default output hash is 1024 bits, while the default for SHA-256 defaults to 256 bits, and having a longer hash is automatically more secure.
