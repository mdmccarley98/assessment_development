## Stem
An implementation of a hash tree, also known as a Merkle Tree, is an essential part of blockchain technology. Most Merkle Trees are depicted as binary trees with two child nodes for each parent node, but blockchain Merkle Trees can have many more child nodes. Each leaf or non-leaf node is labeled with a cryptographic hash. What is the primary purpose of the cryptographic hashes in leaf nodes?

Transaction Block Identification

### 3.
New Block Finalization

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: Merkle Trees have many general-purpose applications in computer science. The are an integral part of memory management, task dispatching, and data management. In blockchain they have a very focused role in data validation. How his validation occurs and hidden from most user processes. It is also not well understood by many developers.
