## Stem
Sharding is a data partitioning technique used in some blockchain designs to improve scalability and process more transactions per second. First- and second-generation blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have one continuous chain of data blocks. Newer blockchain designs have started experimenting with sharding, and it is a critical feature in the Ethereum2 design. A sharded blockchain has a main chain of data blocks, but each block on the main chain can also have one or more of its own side chains. Those side chains are referred to as shards. Dividing a blockchain into shards can reduce latency, but it also creates some security concerns. What are the security concerns related to blockchain sharding?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The implementation of sharding in blockchain systems is still in its early stages. The potential for security problems caused by sharding is not fully known.

## Distractors
### 1.
Sharding is a mature and well-understood data management architecture that has been used in distributed database management systems for decades. Other than the need to have adequate data validation, there are no other known security problems caused by blockchain sharding.

### 2.
Sharding is a new data management architecture that has only recently been implemented in database and data management architectures. Other than the need to have adequate data validation, there are no other known security problems caused by blockchain sharding.

### 3.
The implementation of sharding in blockchain systems is still in its early stages. The need for adequate data validation is the only security risk associated with blockchain sharding.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That sharding has positive benefits without also creating other design problems that can compromise the integrity of a blockchain.
