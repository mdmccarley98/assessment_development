## Stem
Partitioning, or Sharding, separates rows or columns in a larger database into multiple smaller database tables. It is an optimizing process that is commonly used in database management systems. Sharding was listed as a requirement in the transition of Ethereum (ETH) to Ethereum 2 (ETH2). However, it has not been included in the official merge from ETH to ETH2.
<br><br>
Why was Sharding not implemented in the ETH2 transition?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The implementation of Layer 2 (L2) blockchain systems reduced the scaling issues Sharding was expected to correct.

## Distractors
### 1.
Sharding proved to be technically infeasible because blockchains can not be separated into smaller tables like traditional database management systems.

### 2.
The transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake eliminated the need for Sharding.

### 3.
Sharding was implemented but rebranded as Validator Partitioning to maintain the legacy structure of ETH after the transition to ETH2.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: Blockchain governance decisions can make significant changes to the operation of a blockchain. One of them is whether the chain can be divided into shards. Implementing shards requires substantial changes to the consensus, validation, and proof functionality that must work in an interoperable way, passing data between shards.
