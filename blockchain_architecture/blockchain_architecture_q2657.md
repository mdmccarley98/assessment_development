## Stem
Cryptographic key escrow is a process in which a key is held in escrow or stored by a third party. Data encrypted by the user using the userâ€™s key is also encrypted using the escrow key. If the user loses their key or the passphrase for their key, the escrow authority can recover the data for the user with the escrowed key. How does Ethereum use escrowed keys to recover keys in user wallets?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Ethereum does not use an escrow key. If the user loses their 12-word recovery phrase, their keys cannot be recovered.

## Distractors
### 1.
Ethereum stores an escrow key in the block with the first transaction for each user. That block/transaction can be accessed by the user to recover lost keys.

### 2.
Ethereum stores a key restoration block containing the escrow keys. As new users set up Ethereum accounts and generate new keys for their wallets, the process concludes with creating a key restoration block.

### 3.
Ethereum offers an escrow service for an additional fee, but it is not included in the regular process of setting up an Ethereum account. The user must request the escrow service and pay the additional fee when a new wallet is configured.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That only one key can be used to encrypt a data stream or document.
