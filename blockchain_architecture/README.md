# Blockchain Architecture - Claims with Content and Item Specifications (WIP)
The primary three claim areas that this initial Blockchain Architecture atom will assess focus on Data Immutability, Decentralization, Validation, Data Encoding, Hashing, Consensus, Digital Signatures, and Encryption.  

## Claims
- **Claim 1:** The candidate understands the core relationships between Data Immutability, Decentralization, Validation, and Consensus; can evaluate how modifications to one or more of those architecture design elements impact the others. The candidate understands Encryption, Hashing, and Data Encoding to provide a security model for a Blockchain Architecture. The candidate can design and model the operation of critical features for a Blockchain Architecture, create system state diagrams, and make predictions about how decentralized system components will behave under normal conditions and when a fraudulent condition is detected. The candidate understands the structure of blocks that can be created and added to the Blockchain Architecture–this includes the creation, e.g., “mining” process, all the valid data structures and data encoding that a block can contain, and how blocks store executable code in the form of “Smart Contracts”. The candidate understands the existing standards used by public blockchains to implement “Smart Contracts”, selection of the next “miner” authorized to create and add a block, how rejected “miners” are compensated, how disputes are resolved, and how blocks are declared to be “final”.
- **Claim 2:** The candidate understands the core relationships between Encryption, Hashing, Digital Signatures, and Data Encoding. The candidate can evaluate how modifications to the Encryption and Data Encoding processes impact the creation and use of Digital Signatures and Hashes. The candidate understands the differences between symmetric encryption algorithms and asymmetric public key infrastructure (PKI) algorithms and the best practices for implementing them in a Blockchain Architecture. The candidate understands how secret keys, public keys, and private keys are used and the standards for when each should be implemented in a Blockchain Architecture. The candidate also understands how to use passphrases to protect encryption keys in transit and at rest. The candidate understands using “hot” and “cold” wallets to store keys, cryptocurrency, and token ownership data. The candidate also understands how Merkle trees are used to store blockchain data in wallets and other blockchain components.
- **Claim 3:** The candidate understands Blockchain Architecture governance, e.g., the change management process. The candidate understands how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are created and managed. The candidate also understands how token-based membership and Governance Tokens are issued and managed by a DAO. The candidate understands the difference between a “soft fork” and a “hard fork” in a Blockchain Architecture. The candidate also understands the rationale and consequences of implementing either or both. The candidate understands the theory behind and how to implement all the standard “Proof” mechanisms that underlie blockchain governance decision making and controls for new block creation.

## Definition of Scores
Candidates of the following scores demonstrate the associated understanding and abilities:

- **Level 1:** The candidate is unfamiliar with the core architecture components and only demonstrates a basic understanding of Blockchain Architecture concepts. They cannot construct and describe the most basic parts of a Blockchain Architecture and explain how the decentralized system functions.
- **Level 2:** The candidate is familiar with core architecture components and has a basic understanding of Blockchain Architecture concepts. They can construct and describe the most basic parts of a Blockchain Architecture but lacks sufficient knowledge and system design expertise to effectively communicate how the components interact and impact each other in a decentralized environment.
- **Level 3:** The candidate understands the design and structure of blocks, how individual transactions are assigned to blocks, and how the addition of blocks is propagated throughout a Blockchain architecture. They can examine block hashes and determine whether the integrity of the architecture has been maintained. They have the basic knowledge required to determine the state of the current validated blockchain and locate faults and errors that may have been introduced by poor programming practices or contradictions in the system design. They can identify what transactions in a block contain executable code, e.g., “Smart Contracts”, or metadata that isn’t associated with a simple token or coin transfer and analyze their content. They have a fundamental understanding of change management in a decentralized system architecture.
- **Level 4:** The candidate has a strong working knowledge of public key infrastructure (PKI) systems and how they are implemented in Blockchain Architectures to verify the identity of users submitting transactions. They understand the internal system mechanisms that make hashing and digital signature algorithms secure for use in Blockchain Architectures. They know how “Smart Contract” coding and execution are utilized and can understand each step in the process of executing code across thousands or millions of decentralized computers that are only theoretically executing that code simultaneously. They have a working knowledge of how connective systems, like cryptocurrency exchanges and L2 DiFi liquidity pools, interact with and impact processing in a decentralized Blockchain Architecture. They can design an update mechanism that will successfully implement governance and change management across a decentralized Blockchain Architecture.
- **Level 5:** The candidate has an expert understanding of all relevant theoretical and practical aspects of Blockchain Architecture. They understand the system design and state mechanics from the high-level system diagram all the way down to the detailed constructs in each system component. They can roll back through each system state transition to identify the cause of a system design failure or malfunction even when the problem results from widely distributed seemingly unrelated activity spread across a decentralized matrix of nodes. They have a strong working knowledge of network telecommunications protocols and how they are used to create the decentralized matrix of nodes that “mine” new blocks and validate blocks after they are added to the Blockchain Architecture. They can analyze the impacts of governance and change management and implement a correction or rollback process if one is needed. They can explain to non-technical observers why Bitcoin is a “Cryptocurrency transaction system” and Ethereum is a “World Computer”, and why they are different.
