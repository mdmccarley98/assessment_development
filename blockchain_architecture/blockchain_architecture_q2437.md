## Stem
Why are Level 2 applications, state channels, and side chains implemented to work in conjunction with Level 1 blockchain functionality?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
All monolithic implementations of blockchain struggle to achieve scalability at Level 1. Every system has a specific amount of bandwidth and can only process a certain number of transactions per second.

## Distractors
### 1.
Implementing the Lightning Network for Bitcoin increased the sustainable transaction rate from 3,000 per second to 7,000 per second. This more than doubled the number of blocks that can be processed and added to Bitcoin.

### 2.
The Raiden network for Ethereum and the Lightning Network for Bitcoin are examples of side chains. They were implemented to improve the scalability of Level 1 blockchains.

### 3.
Sharding is the universal method of increasing transactions per second for all Level 1 blockchains. Sharding is a built-in feature of the blockchain architecture for cryptocurrencies that was not initially enabled in Bitcoin or Ethereum.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information: 
The transaction per minute problem is connected to blockchain's core validation and consensus features. Without significantly impacting security, there is no way to overcome it in a monolithic architecture.
