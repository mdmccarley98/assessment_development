## Stem
Current research in scalability and off-chain transactional networks and sidechains benefit the scalability and security model which enables all blockchains to operate. Proofs exist that can enable inheritance between blockchain security models without the approval of miners, without centralized entities or federated nodes, and without imposing additional technology limitations on blockchains.
<br><br>
What is the name of the proof that can enable this capability?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Proof of Proof

## Distractors
### 1.
Proof of Inheritance

### 2.
Proof of Hierarchy

### 3.
Proof of Domain

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That blockchains are completely independent of each other and can not share proof and consensus methods.
