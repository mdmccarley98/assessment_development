## Stem
The cryptographic keyspace in blockchain is the set of all valid, possible, and distinct keys of the cryptosystem. The total number of possible values for keys in a cryptographic algorithm with a 20-bit key is 1,048,576. How many possible key values are reduced if one bit in the 20-bit keyspace is locked in a “0” or “1” position?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The reduction in possible keys cannot be determined without knowing which bit is locked.

## Distractors
### 1.
Locking a bit reduces the keyspace by a minimum of 50% of the available keys, leaving no more than 524,288 possible keys.

### 2.
Locking a bit reduces the keyspace by 1/20th of the available keys, which removes 52,428 possible keys from the keyspace.

### 3.
Locking a bit does not reduce the keyspace.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That all devices utilize the entire keyspace. Many wallets and key generation protocols are flawed, and they do not generate keys using the full keyspace.
