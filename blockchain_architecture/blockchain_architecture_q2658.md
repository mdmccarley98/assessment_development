## Stem
Proof of Importance is a consensus method utilized by the NEM blockchain. It was developed to be an improvement for the Proof of Stake consensus that prevents concentrations of wealth from reaping the rewards from block creation. Which of the following is true for Proof of Importance?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Proof of Importance mining can occur without a dedicated mining system connected to the blockchain.

## Distractors
### 1.
Proof of Importance implements a ranking process that does not use math-based metrics.

### 2.
Proof of Importance has the potential to introduce an invalid consensus loop problem because block creation costs no resources.

### 3.
Proof of Importance has a variable environmental impact and can exceed Proof of Workâ€™s impact if the math-based metrics are poorly selected and weighted.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That the mining process always requires dedicated and specialized computing resources. That those resources must be online and operating continuously to participate in the mining process.
