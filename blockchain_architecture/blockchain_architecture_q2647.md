## Stem
Cribs and Bombes have proven to be very effective techniques in cryptanalysis because they speed up finding the cryptographic key and reduce the mathematical complexity of the encryption. How effective are Cribs and Bombes in cryptoanalysis attacks against hash functions used in blockchain systems?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Cribs and Bombes do not affect cryptoanalysis or the security of hashes used in blockchain systems.

## Distractors
### 1.
Cribs do not affect cryptoanalysis. Bombes significantly reduce the security of hashes used in blockchain systems.

### 2.
Cribs significantly reduce the security of hashes used in blockchain systems. Bombes do not affect cryptoanalysis.

### 3.
Cribs and Bombes have a significant effect on cryptoanalysis, and they reduce the security of hashes used in blockchain systems by as much as 50%.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That verification of a hash requires decryption of the hash signature attached to the data. The verification is done testing the hash using the public key. Even if the data used to create a hash is encrypted, the entirety of the input data is still available for analysis.
