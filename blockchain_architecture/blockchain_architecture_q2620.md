## Stem
Why are blockchain implementations deployed using virtual machines instead of docker containers?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Blockchain implementations run on different operating systems and hardware configurations

## Distractors
### 1.
Docker containers are not well suited to running multiple applications on a single operating system

### 2.
Virtual machines are more portable than Docker containers due to container size and the inability to start the Docker immediately

### 3.
Docker containers are more resource-intensive than virtual machines

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information: 
Common misconceptions: Docker containers have many advantages over virtual machines. They allow faster development and deployment than virtual machines. Yet they are not used in blockchain implementations. It is because they lack the ability to completely encompass all the components of the deployed system without reliance on a specific operating system and hardware implementation.
