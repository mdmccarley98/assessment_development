## Stem
What is the crucial difference between blocks created by Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Satoshi Version (BSV)?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The BSV block can be up to 128MB, and the BTC block is limited to only 1MB.

## Distractors
### 1.
The BSV block contains hashes for the previous block and the next block.  The BTC block only has a hash of the previous block.

### 2.
Every BSV block ends with the text “Craig Steven Wright is Satoshi.” and BTC does not.

### 3.
There is no difference.  BTC and BSV blocks are interchangeable.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That there is only one standard implementation for Bitcoin.
