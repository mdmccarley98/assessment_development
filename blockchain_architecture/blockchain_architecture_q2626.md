What is the difference between a Blockchain hard fork and a soft fork?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Only one blockchain will remain valid with a soft fork as users adopt the update. The old and new blockchains exist alongside each other in a hard fork, meaning the software must be updated to work by the new rules.

## Distractors
### 1.
A soft fork occurs when miners agree on the update, and a hard fork occurs when miners are not in agreement but are forced to accept the update to keep a single version of the blockchain.

### 2.
A soft fork and a hard fork are the same process and achieve the same results. The only difference is whether there is a formal governance process in place that controls the timing and implementation of the fork.

### 3.
A soft fork is a minor bug fix that has a negligible impact on the operation of a blockchain. A hard fork is a significant bug fix that has severe operational implications for the operation of a blockchain.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: Forks are not always a bad implementation decision. Because blockchain data is supposed to be immutable, the concept of having a fork that fixes an unexpected problem has been maligned.
