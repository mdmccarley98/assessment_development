## Stem
Proof of Location verifies where a device is when a transaction or request is made. It is used by processes that need to protect the user's privacy while confirming the reported physical location of the user's device. Which of the following is FALSE for implementations of Proof of Location?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Proof of Location uses the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which cannot be spoofed if the GPS location is computed using eight or more concurrent satellites.

## Distractors
### 1.
Proof of Location is essential in the Internet of Things, Supply Chain, and Insurance applications where the location of an asset needs to be known in real-time with high precision.

### 2.
Proof of Location can utilize a centralized infrastructure or a decentralized infrastructure depending upon the level of trust users require to accept the accuracy of the location data.

### 3.
Proof of Location uses a digital certificate issued using a trusted process to verify the device in question's physical location.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That itâ€™s easy to determine location using GPS without the possibility of spoofing.
