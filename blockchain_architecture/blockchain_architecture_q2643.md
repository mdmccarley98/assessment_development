## Stem
A proof that is utilized in a distributed file or cloud-based file system to ensure that the file system and a client that owns the file can verify a file exists and is intact is Proof of Retrievability. What are the three primary challenges in implementing a file system using Proof of Retrievability?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
- 1. maintaining economic incentives for clients to participate
- 2. ensuring that clients maintain independent file storage devices instead of pooling devices
- 3. constructing an adversarial model to verify that the distributed POR protocol is secure

## Distractors
### 1.
- 1. maintaining economic incentives for clients to participate
- 2. creating a distributed hash of the client’s private key to verify ownership of each fragment of the stored file
- 3. ensuring that clients maintain independent file storage devices instead of pooling devices

### 2.
- 1. ensuring that clients maintain independent file storage devices instead of pooling devices
- 2. creating a distributed hash of the client’s private key to verify ownership of each fragment of the stored file
- 3. constructing an adversarial model to verify that the distributed POR protocol is secure

### 3.
- 1. maintaining economic incentives for clients to participate
- 2. creating a distributed hash of the client’s private key to verify ownership of each fragment of the stored file
- 3. constructing an adversarial model to verify that the distributed POR protocol is secure

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That a retrievability model rendered as a proof has just one focus area on the physical storage location. Distributed file systems that are secured by blockchain hashes need quick verification and difficult calculations on where the segments of the files are stored to maintain security.
