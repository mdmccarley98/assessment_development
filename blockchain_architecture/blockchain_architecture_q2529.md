## Stem
What is the maximum size for a blockchain?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Blockchain size is not a problem that needs to be resolved. There is no maximum size.

## Distractors
### 1.
Blockchains that reach 20GB must be pruned and archived.

### 2.
The maximum size is dependent on the size of the blocks and pointers that connect the blocks.

### 3.
The maximum size depends on whether the blockchain is a Level 1 (L1) or Level 2 (L2) implementation. L1 is limited to 20GB. L2 is limited to 200GB.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: Scalability and transaction speed are problems that need to be solved. A blockchain's total size after years of use is practically unlimited.
