Staking favors users with more financial resources, and mining favors users with specialized computational machines.

### 2.
Staking requires Smart Contracts and mining does not.

### 3.
Mining requires more computational power than staking.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That mining and staking are equal and interchangeable functions in blockchain operations.
