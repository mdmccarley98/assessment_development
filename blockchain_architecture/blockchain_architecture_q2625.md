## Stem
Bitcoin does not implement “Smart Contracts” using the same method as Ethereum. Does this make the Bitcoin VM more efficient than the Ethereum VM?

## Code Snippet (optional)

Bitcoin uses a scripting language (Script), and Ethereum uses an object-oriented language (Solidity), making measuring their relative efficiency challenging.

The Bitcoin VM is more than 10x more efficient than the Ethereum VM.

### 2. 
The Ethereum VM is more than 10x more efficient than the Bitcoin VM.

### 3. 
The Bitcoin VM and the Ethereum VM are comparably the same.
