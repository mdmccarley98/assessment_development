Multiple Choice

## Stem
Virtual machines attempt to create a higher level of abstraction within the operating system of a computer. Ethereum uses a virtual machine to maintain and communicate the current condition of the Ethereum blockchain. Choose the statement that is TRUE for the Ethereum virtual machine?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The Ethereum virtual machine is Turing complete because it maintains a single “state” at any time.

## Distractors
### 1.
The Ethereum virtual machine is Turing complete because each individual instance can maintain multiple “states” at any time.

### 2.
The Ethereum virtual machine is not Turing complete because it can only maintain a single “state” at any time.

### 3.
The Ethereum virtual machine is not Turing complete because each individual instance of it can maintain multiple “states” at any time.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: Even though all Ethereum virtual machine nodes spread around the world may not be synchronized at any given time, they are all maintaining one “state” at any time. As they receive validated updates each EVM will update its “state” to represent the current state of the entire blockchain.
