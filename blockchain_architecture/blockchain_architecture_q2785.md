## Stem
Cryptocurrencies tied directly to another currency, commodity, or financial instrument are called Stablecoins. They are supposed to be pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar and expected to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies that are not pegged. Algorithmic Stablecoins are a particular category of Stablecoins.
<br><br>
Here is a list of attributes of an Algorithmic Stablecoin:
<ul>
    <li>I. Uses supply and demand to maintain the pegged value.</li>
    <li>II. Uses Proof of Space and Time to maintain the pegged value.</li>
    <li>III. Requires the use of a Stablecoin and a Cryptocurrency to back it.</li>
    <li>IV. Requires the use of two Cryptocurrencies to back it.</li>
    <li>V. A Smart Contract monitors and regulates the algorithm to maintain the relationship between the Stablecoin and Cryptocurrency.</li>
    <li>VI. A Smart Contract monitors and regulates the algorithm to maintain the relationship between two Cryptocurrencies.</li>
    <li>VII. Proof of Delegated Stake is used to regulate the algorithm and maintain the relationship between the Stablecoin and Cryptocurrency.</li>
</ul>

Some of the above attributes are TRUE, and some are FALSE. Choose the option below that contains only the TRUE attributes from the list.
