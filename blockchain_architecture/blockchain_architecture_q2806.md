## Stem
DAOs are decentralized and managed by Smart Contractsâ€“computer-controlled rules that govern the organization's operation. The two most common organization models are token-based and share-based membership. That being said, DAOs have a variety of voting mechanisms that ensure that governance and change management remains decentralized and encourage more DAO members to contribute to the decision-making process. However, DAO members are not required to participate in every vote and can choose to leave the DAO at any time.
