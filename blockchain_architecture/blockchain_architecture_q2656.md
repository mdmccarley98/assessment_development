Multiple Choice

## Stem
Blockchain-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent a new governance model representing various parties that share control over an organization whose bylaws have been defined by source code in Smart Contracts. DAOs represent an organization that does not have a typical physical structure where users have voting rights in some or all procedures. Which of the following is NOT a feature of DAOs?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The Howey Test can be avoided by Juicebox DAOs that implement a tiered governance token structure.

## Distractors
### 1.
Governance tokens are not security tokens because they are used to influence and control the DAO protocol’s direction.

### 2.
DAOs are recognized in the US state of Wyoming as legal corporate entities, but in areas without legal status, DAOs are typically considered a general partnership.

### 3.
There is regulatory uncertainty regarding how DAOs can create and issue tokens from the DAO treasury without having them labeled as securities.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That having a DAO means it’s not possible for only a few people to control the activities of the organization.
