## Stem
When two or more new blocks are created concurrently and released to the blockchain mainnet by different miners, only one of the new blocks can be validated as the next block added to the blockchain. How is this problem resolved?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The block added to the longest validated segment of the blockchain is considered the new block. Transactions from the other blocks are returned to the transaction pool for selection in a future block.

## Distractors
### 1.
All the concurrently created blocks are Orphan Blocks and discarded. The transactions they contained are returned to the transaction pool for selection in a future block.

### 2.
All the concurrently created blocks are Stale Blocks and discarded. The transactions they contained are returned to the transaction pool for selection in a future block.

### 3.
The block added to the longest validated segment of the blockchain is considered the new block. Transactions from the other blocks are rejected and lost. Those transactions must be resubmitted before being included in a future block.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That only one block can be created using a proof as the next block to add to the mainnet of a blockchain. With so many systems working on the proof, there is a fair chance that two or more blocks will be validated concurrently and the which on should remain as the next block has to be resolved.
