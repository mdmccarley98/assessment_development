Which of the following blockchain implementations would most benefit from using Proof of Ownership?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)

## Distractors
### 1.
Fungible Tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum that can represent fractional ownership in a coin and be used as a medium of exchange

### 2.
Tokens that are staked in a distributed finance (DiFi) liquidity pool and be used to limit the possibility of impermanent loss

### 3.
An Ethereum Layer 2 application that uses Proof of Stake to mine new tokens and Ethereum to validate its security model

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information: 
Common misconceptions: That the ownership of fungible and non-fungible digital assets is the same and can be managed the same.
