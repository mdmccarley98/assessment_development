What is Bitcoin governance?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The process for evolving Bitcoin is one of consensus building, where deliberation and persuasion are critical but where all participants always retain volition.

## Distractors
### 1.
Bitcoin does not have any governance, and changes other than minor bug fixes cannot be implemented.

### 2.
Miners control all updates made to the Bitcoin Core software client that the community of nodes chooses to run.

### 3.
Bitcoin is a static protocol, and every modification to it by a consensus of miners and validators creates a “hard fork” that is not backward compatible with previous versions of Bitcoin.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: Many people mistakenly believe that because Bitcoin does not have a formalized process for submission of “Improvement Proposals” like Ethereum’s EIP process where proposals are presented, debated, and voted on by stakeholders, and then all Ethereum nodes adhere to the decision, Bitcoin does not have any method of governance beyond minor bug fixes to the network.
