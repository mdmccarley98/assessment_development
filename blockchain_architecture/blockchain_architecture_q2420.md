## Stem
How does impermanent loss affect liquidity providers in blockchain distributed finance (DiFi)?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
When tokens are deposited into a liquidity pool and the price changes over time, the amount lost due to that change is the impermanent loss.

## Distractors
### 1. 
Impermanent loss occurs when two tokens with a 50/50 ratio of value are deposited but can be reduced or eliminated if the ratio deposited is 75/25 or greater.

### 2. 
Depositing a stable coin as one of the tokens in a 50/50 ratio will eliminate impermanent loss.

### 3. 
Trading fees earned while tokens are deposited into a liquidity pool are always greater than impermanent loss and can be used to cancel out the effect of price changes.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information: 

Common misconceptions: That there is a single equation that can be used to predict and control impermanent loss in a liquidity pool when the value of the coins/tokens deposited in it are determined by a myriad of outside forces beyond the control of the liquidity investor.
