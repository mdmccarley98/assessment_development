Why are Base58 and Base64(HEX) used in Blockchain to represent addresses, passphrases, and other data that are transmitted, stored, and printed?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
They offer a balance between compact performance, readability, definition, and error prevention.

## Distractors
### 1.
Base58 and HEX encoding can convert a public key into a private one.

### 2. 
A conversion between Base58 and HEX allows users to turn a Bitcoin address into an Ethereum address that can be used on both blockchains.

### 3. 
Base58 and HEX provide an extra layer of encryption for private keys and passphrases when printed and stored as a backup.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That data encoding is synonymous with encryption.  That data represented in alphanumeric form is not encoded.
