## Stem
Immutable data is a piece of information in a database that cannot be (or shouldnâ€™t be) deleted or modified. Most traditional databases store data in a mutable format, meaning the database overwrites the older data when new data is available. Blockchains store data in an immutable format. Which of the following is NOT an advantage of using immutable data?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Complexity

## Distractors
### 1.
Compliance

### 2.
Faster Operations

### 3.
Historical Context

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: Locking records in any database, blockchain or not, is a time-consuming operation. By only appending records to the end of the chain instead of allowing modifications within the chain blockchains operate faster even if they do not operate as fast as some traditional database management systems.
