## Stem
Blockchain networks are susceptible to routing attacks that impact miners’ revenue and can compromise the security and integrity of the blockchain. Two of those attacks are delay attacks and partition attacks. Which system architecture provides the most protection against delay and partition attacks?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Distribute the block creation and validation nodes widely and uniformly across the entire network of available systems.

## Distractors
### 1.
Cluster large groups of block creation and validation nodes in common sub-networks.

### 2.
Upgrade all systems to utilize Border Gateway Protocol routing and remove Router Internet Protocol and Open Shortest Path First Protocol systems from the network.

### 3.
Turn on the “NOHIJACK” option in the router managing all sub-networks where block creation and validation nodes are located to lock the data packet headers and prevent delay and partition attacks.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That routing happens automatically within a blockchain network and Internet protocols prevent it from being interrupted.
