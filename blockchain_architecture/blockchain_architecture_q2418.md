An ICO is the blockchain cryptocurrency industry’s equivalent to an initial public offering (IPO). A company seeking to raise money can launch an ICO to raise funds.

## Distractors
### 1. 
An ICO is the blockchain cryptocurrency industry’s equivalent to an initial public offering (IPO). A company seeking to raise money via an ICO must produce all the same documentation and get approval from the same government regulators as required for an IPO.

### 2. 
Only accredited financial institutions can launch an ICO. A company seeking to raise funds via an ICO must engage an accredited financial institution before seeking approval from government regulators.

### 3. 
An ICO is the blockchain industry’s method of raising funds. It is wholly unregulated and open to everyone. A company seeking to raise money can launch an ICO without concern for how the coins are used or who purchases them.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information: 
Common misconceptions:  ICOs do not translate into equity in the business or project that issues them. Most ICOs are considered securities by government regulators due to the process of funding something that will not have value until some point in the future or will increase in value in the future.
