What is the difference between a Utility Token and a Security Token?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer) 
Security tokens grant ownership shares in a company. Utility tokens grant special access or promotions for future products or services.

## Distractors
### 1.
Security tokens and Utility tokens are different names for the same type of blockchain artifact. The term Utility token is an attempt to avoid government regulation of token offering as securities.

### 2.
Utility tokens grant ownership shares in a company. Security tokens grant preferred shares that have greater investment value than Utility tokens.

### 3.
Utility tokens can only be granted and used outside of the operations and governance of the blockchain. Security tokens are used inside the operations and governance of the blockchain to control updates, upgrades, and bug fixes.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information: 
Labeling a coin offering as a Utility token or a Security token controls how government regulators will categorize it.
