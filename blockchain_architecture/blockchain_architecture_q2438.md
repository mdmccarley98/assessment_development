## Stem
Which of the following statements is NOT true of asymmetric (PKI) encryption?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Asymmetric encryption is faster than symmetric encryption because of its longer key lengths, and asymmetric encryption calculations tend to be much less complex than their symmetric counterparts.

## Distractors
### 1.
Asymmetric encryption eliminates key distribution entirely. The needed public keys are exchanged through public-key servers, and the disclosure of public keys is not, at this time, detrimental to the security of encrypted messages because they cannot be used to derive private keys.

### 2.
The private keys needed to decrypt sensitive information are never, and should not ever be, exchanged over a potentially compromised communication channel, and thatâ€™s a significant plus for the security and integrity of encrypted messages.

### 3.
Senders can use their private keys to digitally sign and verify that a message or file originated from them and not an untrusted third party.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
That symmetric and asymmetric encryption use the same algorithms, and only the key generation and key management are different.
