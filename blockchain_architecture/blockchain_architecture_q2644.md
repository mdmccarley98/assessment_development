## Stem
When two or more new blocks are created simultaneously by blockchain miners, only one block can be added. Ethereum calls the unused blocks Ommer Blocks. Ommer Blocks are like Orphan Blocks created by Bitcoin. What is the most significant difference between how Ethereum treats Ommer Blocks and Bitcoin treats Orphan Blocks?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Miners and validators can receive an incentive to create Ommer Blocks from Ethereum that creators of Orphan Blocks do not receive from Bitcoin.

## Distractors
### 1.
Ethereum users forfeit the cost of gas for the Ommer Block transactions, and Bitcoin does not charge a transaction fee for Orphan Blocks.

### 2.
Ethereum returns the gas fees for Ommer Blocks, and Bitcoin charges a transaction fee for Orphan Blocks.

### 3.
There is no difference. Ethereum and Bitcoin use the same process to return Ommer Blocks and Orphan Blocks to the transaction pool.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That only one block can be created using a proof as the next block to add to the mainnet of a blockchain. With so many systems working on the proof, there is a fair chance that two or more blocks will be validated concurrently and the which on should remain as the next block has to be resolved.
