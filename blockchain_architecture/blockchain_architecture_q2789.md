Multiple Choice

## Stem
Data accessibility, data insecurity, and identification of fraudulent identities are all identity management issues that can be eradicated using blockchain technology. Which option is TRUE for Proof of Identity?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Proof of Identity is not a blockchain consensus method.

## Distractors
### 1.
Proof of Work and Proof of Stake can be replaced by Proof of Identity to reduce the carbon footprint of blockchain systems.

### 2.
Proof of Identity can not be implemented independently as a consensus method. It must be paired with another blockchain consensus method.

### 3.
A strong hashing algorithm, like SHA3, must be used in conjunction with Proof of Identity before Proof of Identity can be implemented as a blockchain consensus method.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: Proving identity is a core feature of blockchain. It is not an independent consensus method like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.
