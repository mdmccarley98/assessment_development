What is a 51% attack, and how is it executed?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
A 51% attack occurs when a single person or group of people gains control of over 50% of a blockchainâ€™s hashing power. The person or group can add fraudulent blocks.

## Distractors
### 1.
A 51% attack occurs when a malicious person or group submits over 50% of the transactions in a single block. The person or group can add fraudulent transactions.

### 2.
A 51% attack occurs when a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack removes more than 50% of the miners from the network and prevents them from doing Proof of Work. Miners cannot calculate the next nonce, and new blocks cannot be added.

### 3.
A 51% attack occurs when more than 50% of the miners cannot calculate the next nonce because the nonce generation difficulty level is set too high. Miners cannot calculate the next nonce, and new blocks cannot be added.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
It takes more than 50% control of the hash power to commit fraud on a blockchain. There are situations where it is possible to commit fraud with as little as 34% control of specific functionality within the blockchain. This usually takes a multifaceted attack executed over a significant amount of time.
