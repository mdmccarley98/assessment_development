## Stem
Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding a non-fungible token (NFT)?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
NFTs are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other.

## Distractors
### 1.
NFTs can not function to represent identities for individuals or property rights.

### 2.
NFTs are identical to each other and, therefore, can serve as a medium for commercial transactions.

### 3.
NFTs can be replicated and distributed by the NFT owner once the NFT's unique cryptographic tokens exist on a blockchain.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: NFTs are not the same as cryptocurrency or most other crypto assets. Many of the functions of NFTs are implemented like Web 2.0 applications rather than Web 3.0 applications.
