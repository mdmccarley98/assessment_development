## Stem
Proof of space is a technique where provers show they can allocate unused hard drive space for a future operation that uses the storage. It is used with Proof of Time to ensure the blocks are consistent with the requirements and will be available when they are needed. What is the crucial mathematical algorithm used to confirm that all requirements are in place when Proof of Space and Time are combined and used in a unified operation?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Variable Delay Function

## Distractors
### 1.
Parallel Delay Function

### 2.
Cryptographic Variable Function

### 3.
Benign Fill Function

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That all proofs must be individual proofs rather than getting enhanced functionality from combining the best features of multiple proofs.
