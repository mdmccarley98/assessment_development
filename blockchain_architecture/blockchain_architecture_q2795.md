## Stem
The original design of Ethereum limited its scalability to no more than about 15 transactions per second. What change is planned that will allow Ethereum to use less electrical power and improve scaling above the current limit of 15 transactions per second?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer) 
Replace Proof of Work with Proof of Stake

## Distractors
### 1.
Double the size of the maximum allowed Ethereum transaction block

### 2.
Replace Proof of Stake with Proof of History

### 3.
Cut the size of the maximum allowed Ethereum transaction block in half

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That an existing blockchain cannot change its core consensus proof. A good governance model and active user community is required to effectively make a proof change.
