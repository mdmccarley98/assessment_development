## Stem
Which of the following statements is NOT true of symmetric encryption?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Symmetric encryption uses a single, public cryptographic key to encrypt and decrypt information.

## Distractors
### 1.
Symmetric encryption algorithms like AES take billions of years to crack using brute-force attacks.

### 2.
Because of its shorter key lengths and relative simplicity, symmetric encryption is much faster to execute than asymmetric encryption.

### 3.
Symmetric encryption algorithms like AES have become the gold standard of data encryption because of their security and speed benefits. As such, they have enjoyed decades of industry adoption and acceptance.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That symmetric and asymmetric encryption use the same algorithms, and only the key generation and key management are different.
