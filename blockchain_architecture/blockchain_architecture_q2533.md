## Stem
In blockchain implementations, incentives are used to encourage participants to form communities and cooperate in ways that will create value. Their continued cooperation with participants in other communities of interest ensures the long-term success of the platform. When incentives are defined and allocated for participants and communities, which community must receive the most incentive to create an environment that will increase value and success?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The community that is least likely to participate and continue using the system

## Distractors
### 1.
The community mining new transactions into blocks

### 2.
The community validating the addition of new blocks to reach a system consensus

### 3.
The community that identifies malicious actors and fraud before new blocks are added to the system and finalized

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That incentives are awarded to all types of blockchain users. The people who are least likely to join and use the Blockchain are just incentivized the most.
