## Stem
Which of the following is NOT true about Bitcoinâ€™s Proof of Work implementation?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Miners compute iterations of an integer, called a nonce, using SHA-3(256-bit) until one results in a hash that meets or exceeds the current level of difficulty.

## Distractors
### 1.
The difficulty level can be changed by updating the target output for the hash to keep the interval for adding new blocks to an average of about 10 minutes.

### 2.
Mining is a competitive process that functions as a lottery, so Miners pool their resources to increase their chances of mining blocks.

### 3.
The energy required increases as more miners join the blockchain and compete to mine blocks.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information: 
Common misconceptions: That Proof of Work was invented as part of the Bitcoin Whitepaper.  It was first proposed in 2004.
