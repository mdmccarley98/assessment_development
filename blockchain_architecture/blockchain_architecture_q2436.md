## Stem
How is a number only used once (nonce) used in “Proof of Work”?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
The nonce is an iterated variable hashed with several constants from the previously added block until the newly created hash meets or exceeds the current difficulty level.

## Distractors
### 1.
The nonce is a constant created by hashing the previously added block with a pseudo-random number generator.

### 2.
The nonce is a constant that only changes its value when the hash rate has exceeded the threshold set by the current difficulty level.

### 3.
The nonce is incremented each time a block is added to make the contents of each block unique when the next hash is generated.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- It is a common misconception that the nonce is incremented by one or some other predetermined number to count the blocks as they are added.
- It is also a misconception that the nonce is a constant in each Proof of Work cycle leading to the selection of a miner to add the next block.
