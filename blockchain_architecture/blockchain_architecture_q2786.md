## Stem
Blockchain-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent a new governance model representing various parties that share control over an organization whose bylaws have been defined by source code in Smart Contracts. DAOs represent an organization with no typical physical structure where users have voting rights in some or all procedures. DAOs are not fully accounted for legally, and many push traditional boundaries.
<br><br>
Which of the following is a potential legal problem for DAOs?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
DAOs with anonymous owners can not follow legal requirements for tax filings in many jurisdictions.

## Distractors
### 1.
DAOs need to elect offices and a board of directors.

### 2.
DAOs can’t meet the identifiability standard that most corporations recognize as “right-and-duty bearing units”.

### 3.
DAOs can not establish a traditional legal corporate entity for business operations.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information: 
Common misconceptions:  That DAOs can’t operate like corporations with ownership standards. They just can’t do it with anonymous owners and without declaring a place of business like a standard corporation does.
