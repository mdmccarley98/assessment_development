## Stem
Blockchains are reliable and secure because design principles make the data stored on the ledger immutable. Consensus is needed on fundamental questions using data secured on the ledger. Why are Blockchain Oracles required for the execution of some Smart Contracts?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key (Correct Answer)
Blockchains are not well suited to answering subjective questions based on data that is not easily accessible to every node on the Blockchain.

## Distractors
### 1.
Storing data off-chain increases the security of a Blockchain because data does not need to be easily assessable to every node on the Blockchain.

### 2.
Blockchains cannot be operated as Turing complete systems without access to mutable data, or it limits the number of use cases that can be implemented.

### 3.
Smart Contracts are designed to execute concurrently on all nodes of the Blockchain, and Oracles are required to synchronize the data inputs and outputs when nodes are very decentralized.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common misconceptions: That Smart Contracts have easy access to off-chain data from all sources on the Internet and can easily validate data from off-chain sources.
