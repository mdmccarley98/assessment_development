## Item ID
2715

## Claim
Claim 1

## Threshold Probabilities:
[0.35, 0.55, 0.75, 0.85]

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
[Log-Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_probability)

> The use of log probabilities improves numerical stability, when the probabilities are very small, because of the way in which computers approximate real numbers.

## Content Target

## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
In a database, which of the following would be most appropriately stored as the logarithm of the value instead of the value itself?

## Code Snippet (Optional)

## Answer Key
Values that are positive and extremely close to zero

## Distractors
### 1.
Values that are either zero or one

### 2.
Values following a standard Gaussian distribution

### 3.
Values that are percentages between 1% and 100%

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (Optional):
It is standard to use a logarithmic representation on very small numbers, such as probabilities of unlikely events, as this prevents issues arising with floating-point representations.
