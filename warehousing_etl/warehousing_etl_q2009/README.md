## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
What is a difference between star and snowflake schemas?

## Code Snippet (Optional)

## Answer Key
Star schema stores hierarchy data within a dimensional table, whereas snowflake schema breaks out hierarchies into separate dimensional tables

## Distractors
### 1.
Cube processing is faster for a snowflake schema than a star schema

### 2.
Star schema follows a normalized structure whereas snowflake schema is denormalized

### 3.
Star schema tends to be more complex and have more joins than snowflake schema

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (Optional):
### 1.
Cube processing is typically faster for star schemas as there are fewer join operations to perform

### 2.
The opposite is true -- star schema dimensional data is denormalized while snowflake schema dimensional data is normalized

### 3.
The opposite is true
