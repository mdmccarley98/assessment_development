Characteristics of Star Schema:
- The dimension table are not joined to each other
```

[Star Schema](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14724/star-schema)

```
A star schema is a data warehousing architecture model where one fact table references multiple dimension tables, which, when viewed as a diagram, looks like a star with the fact table in the center and the dimension tables radiating from it.

## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Consider the following set of tables for tracking a retailer's sales of smartphones. Which of the following alterations rearranges the schema such that each dimensional table is related only to the central fact table?

## Code Snippet (Optional)
```
TABLE transactions (id, date, product_id, store_id, price, currency, qty)
TABLE product (id, manufacturer_id, screen_size, front_camera_megapixels, has_headphone_jack)
TABLE manufacturers (id, name, address)
TABLE store (id, address)
```

## Answer Key
Put manufacturer_id in the transactions table instead of the product table

## Distractors
### 1.
Make a new currency table with a row for each possible currency, and refer to that from transactions

### 2.
Move the has_headphone_jack data into a separate table that has only `(product_id, has_headphone_jack)`

### 3.
Store the address as (number, street, city, country) columns instead of one column

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (Optional):
In the initial schema, the dimensional table product is linked to both transactions and manufacturers, making it not a star schema according to the above definition.
