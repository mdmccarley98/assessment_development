## Stem
What is the difference between a natural key and a surrogate key?

## Code Snippet (Optional)

## Answer Key
A natural key is made up of values that are derived from existing application data, whereas a surrogate key is generated and assigned by the system

## Distractors
### 1.
A natural key is a unique identifier of records found within the same table, whereas a surrogate key is a reference to a record in another table

### 2.
A natural key consists of only one column, whereas a surrogate key consists of two or more columns

### 3.
A natural key is used to group similar records together, whereas a surrogate key uniquely identifies records

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (Optional):
### 1.
Both natural and surrogate keys refer to records found within the same table -- they do not reference foreign tables

### 2.
The number of columns used to make up a natural or surrogate key is irrelevant in this context

### 3.
A natural key is a unique identifier, not used to group similar records
