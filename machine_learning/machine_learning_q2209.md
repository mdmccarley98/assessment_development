## Stem

You have trained and deployed four different models to screen for a certain disease. During a trial period, your models made predictions that were compared to expert evaluations, resulting in the following receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves:

Which model should be selected when the most important consideration is a low rate of false negatives? 

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key

Model C

## Distractors
### 1.

Model A

### 2.

Model B

### 3.

Model D


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

While Model B has a slightly higher AUROC overall and would likely be preferred if low false positives were most important, the false negative rate is 1 - true positive rate and Model C achieves the desired highest true positive rate.
