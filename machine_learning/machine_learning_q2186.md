Multiple Choice

## Stem

Stemming and lemmatization are two preprocessing methods for natural language. Both aim to reduce words into a simpler base form such as converting "walking" to "walk".

Which of the following statements accurately contrasts the two methods?


## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key

Lemmatization always outputs a valid word, while stemming can create invalid words

## Distractors
### 1.

Lemmatization requires less computation than stemming for an equal length document

### 2.

Lemmatization only works with the English language, while stemming works for any language

### 3.

Lemmatization processes each word individually, while stemming considers the surrounding context


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

Stemming normally uses simple rules that result in words like removing the "-ed" suffix from "troubled" converting to "troubl" which is not a dictionary word.
