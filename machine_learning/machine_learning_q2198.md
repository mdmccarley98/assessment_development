## Claim Behavior (evidence)

> Note that this is before the effects of round-off error are taken into account; conditioning is a property of the matrix, not the algorithm or floating-point accuracy of the computer used to solve the corresponding system. In particular, one should think of the condition number as being (very roughly) the rate at which the solution x will change with respect to a change in b. Thus, if the condition number is large, even a small error in b may cause a large error in x.

Multiple Choice

## Stem

Consider the linear equation `Ax = b` for matrix `A` and vectors `x`, `b`. 

You solve `x = A⁻¹b` and compute the associated condition number. Which of the following is a valid interpretation of that condition number?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key

It describes the sensitivity of error in `x` to error in `b`

## Distractors
### 1.

It describes the amount of rounding error due to floating-point arithmetic

### 2.

It is zero if matrix `A` is not invertible

### 3.

It is the minimum eigenvalue of `A` divided by the maximum eigenvalue of `A`
