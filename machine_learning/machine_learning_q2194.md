Multiple Choice

## Stem

Which of the following clustering algorithms would be most appropriate given a dataset that has a very large number of data points and clusters that vary widely in size and shape?


## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key

DBSCAN

## Distractors
### 1.

K-Means

### 2.

Affinity propagation

### 3.

Gaussian mixture models


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

K-means and GMM both make assumptions on cluster shape (see plots in reference). Affinity Propagation requires O(N^2 * T) time and O(N^2) memory, making it unscalable for large N.
