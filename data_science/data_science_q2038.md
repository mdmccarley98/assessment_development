## Stem
You have performed a randomized controlled trial to compare two treatments, with the null hypothesis that the treatments are equivalent (their treatment difference is zero). You obtain a small, not statistically significant difference and a corresponding p-value of 0.90. 

Which of the following is a valid interpretation of that p-value?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
There is not enough information to determine if the treatments are equivalent

## Distractors
### 1.
There was an error in the trial such as unadjusted confounders

### 2.
It's safe to accept the null hypothesis because the data are consistent with it

### 3.
90% of repeated experiments will also find a non-statistically-significant difference

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
In the null hypothesis testing paradigm you can never accept/prove the null hypothesis - only disprove it or fail to disprove it. A large p-value indicates nothing more than that your experiment was inconclusive.
