## Stem
Consider a box containing a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, and a 12-sided die. You select a die at random and roll it twice, obtaining a 1 and a 5. What is the probability that you selected the 6-sided die?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
4 / 5

## Distractors
### 1.
1 / 5

### 2.
2 / 5

### 3.
3 / 5

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
The 4-sided die can be eliminated because it doesn't have a 5 on it, leaving only two outcomes. 

Since a number less than 6 is twice as likely on the 6-sided die, the odds ratio is simply P(6 sided) / P(12 sided) = 1:1 * 2:1 * 2:1 = 4:1

The item is fine as written, but I would suggest changing one of the distractors to 1/2. Intuitively, a naive test taker may reason that we can eliminate the first die, leaving two dice. Then the test taker may reason that there is an equal probability that it is the six sided as the 12 sided die (which would make a good prior but not a good posterior). For similar reasons, I'd suggest 1/3 as a distractor, since an even more naive test taker may set a prior probability of 1/3 that it is any one of the dice. That would be a particularly  bad error.
