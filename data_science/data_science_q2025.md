## Stem
Let X1 and X2 be jointly normal (also known as bivariate normal) random variables. They each have variance 1. 

If X1 and X2 have a Pearson correlation coefficient of -3/4, what is the variance of their sum X1 + X2? 

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
1/2

## Distractors
### 1.
2

### 2.
-3/4

### 3.
1

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
It's not necessary to remember the formula for this. Intuitively, since they are negatively correlated then the sum should have lower variance than each individual variable.

The variance is given by var(x) + var(y) + 2 * corr * std(x) * std(y) = 1 + 1 + 2 * -3/4 * 1 * 1 = 1/2
