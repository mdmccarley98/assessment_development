# Statistical Models OLS Heteroscedasticity

## Item ID
2034

## Claim
2

## Threshold Probabilities
[0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> Heteroscedasticity does not cause ordinary least squares coefficient estimates to be biased, although it can cause ordinary least squares estimates of the variance (and, thus, standard errors) of the coefficients to be biased, possibly above or below the true of population variance.

## Stem
Consider a linear model predicting vacation spending from annual income. You notice that people with larger incomes have a larger variance in their vacation spending. The effect of this on an ordinary least squares regression is:

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
The standard error of the slope estimate is biased

## Distractors
### 1.
The intercept estimate is biased

### 2.
There is no impact on the regression

### 3.
The p-values for regression coefficients are too large

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
P-values are calculated from the standard errors, so they are not necessarily too large (could be too small).
