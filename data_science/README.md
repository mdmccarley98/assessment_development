# Data Science - Summary of Claims and Content and Item Specifications (WIP)

## Claims
A candidate who performs well on the Data Science quiz has demonstrated evidence for all three (3) claims. 

### DATA ENGINEERING AND WRANGLING
- Claim 1: Able to clean data and design appropriate representations for modeling tasks.
    - Content Targets (not exhaustive):
        - Inspecting and cleaning data
        - Feature engineering and data manipulation
        - Data exploration and visualization

### MODELING
- Claim 2: Demonstrate knowledge about training and use of common statistical and machine learning models, and the ability to evaluate them with fundamental probability and statistics.
    - Content Targets (not exhaustive):
        - Fitting probabilistic and statistical models (distributions and hypothesis testing)
        - Familiarity with and training ML models (selection and validation)

### BUSINESS ANALYSIS
- Claim 3: Able to evaluate the business value of a model and effectively communicate to stake holders with visualization and key insights
    - Content Targets (not exhaustive):
        - Data visualization
        - Defining evaluation metrics
        - Business insights / inference from statistics
        - A/B testing

## Score-level Definitions
- **Level 1:** The candidate has no more than a superficial understanding of data science. They may be familiar with terminology and the high-level job function, but they fail to demonstrate actual experience with statistical modeling and machine learning. At best they may demonstrate an understanding of probability theory and basic statistics.
- **Level 2:** The candidate knows about some common machine learning algorithms and has exposure to the background mathematical prerequisites for data science. They may have an educational background that covered topics that intersect with the quiz. They struggle with professional issues such as feature engineering, evaluation, and visualization. They have some experience in data wrangling but may struggle with understanding the trade-offs around cleaning choices and design.
- **Level 3:** The candidate is familiar with common statistical and machine learning models. They have a strong intuitive understanding of probability and statistics. They understand the principles of model selection and evaluation. They can reliably define target data representations based on business requirements and data sources.
- **Level 4:** The candidate demonstrates the qualities of a professional data scientist. For a given data problem they are aware of multiple algorithmic options and can weigh the pros and cons of each. They can choose appropriate data designs that take into consideration scalability and capacity to acheive the business objective. Their experience has given them opportunity to develop skills in data visualization and business communication. They may have more breadth than depth in their understanding of data science topics.
- **Level 5:** The candidate complements all the talents of Level 4 with mathematical and statistical maturity, an awareness of statistical modeling pitfalls, and a nuanced understanding of the lifecycle of statistical models. Should be capable of interfacing with the stakeholders to communicate findings, visualize results, and define new directions for research. They have extensive practice with scientific experimental methodology.

## Cognitive Models / Demand
- Recall - can recall/recognize knowledge (e.g., definitions); can recall a memorized procedure to perform a task
- Comprehend - can comprehend/understand knowledge (e.g., how? why?); comprehend procedures to perform a task

## Notes
- SQL is not included because we have a separate SQL quiz
- Modeling doesn't include Deep Learning (perhaps better for a separate quiz)
