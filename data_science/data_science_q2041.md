> Table 1 Twelve P-Value Misconceptions

>1 If P = .05, the null hypothesis has only a 5% chance of being true.

>2 A nonsignificant difference (eg, P >.05) means there is no difference between groups.

>3 A statistically significant finding is clinically important.

>4 Studies with P values on opposite sides of .05 are conflicting.

>5 Studies with the same P value provide the same evidence against the null hypothesis.

>6 P = .05 means that we have observed data that would occur only 5% of the time under the null hypothesis.

>7 P = .05 and P <.05 mean the same thing.

>8 P values are properly written as inequalities (eg, “P <.02” when P = .015)

>9 P =.05 means that if you reject the null hypothesis, the probability of a type I error is only 5%.

>10 With a P = .05 threshold for significance, the chance of a type I error will be 5%.

>11 You should use a one-sided P value when you don’t care about a result in one direction, or a difference in that direction is impossible.

>12 A scientific conclusion or treatment policy should be based on whether or not the P value is significant

Multiple Choice

## Stem
You conduct a large randomized controlled trial comparing a new medicine to decrease blood pressure against a placebo. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the treatment group and a placebo group. You find the treatment did work relative to the placebo and compute a p-value of P = 0.03. 

Which of the following is a valid interpretation of that p-value?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
If the null hypothesis is true, 3% of repeated trials would observe a difference at least this large

## Distractors
### 1.
If we reject the null hypothesis, there is a 3% chance of making a Type 1 error

### 2.
If we repeat the experiment, there is a 3% chance of observing this difference

### 3.
Since the measured difference is statistically significant, it is clinically significant

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
The p-value concept is unintuitive and widely abused in industry.
