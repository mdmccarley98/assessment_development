## Item ID
2039

## Claim
3

## Threshold Probabilities
[0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.525]

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> "Were this procedure to be repeated on numerous samples, the fraction of calculated confidence intervals (which would differ for each sample) that encompass the true population parameter would tend toward 90%."

> A 95% confidence level does not mean that for a given realized interval there is a 95% probability that the population parameter lies within the interval (i.e., a 95% probability that the interval covers the population parameter)

> A 95% confidence level does not mean that 95% of the sample data lie within the confidence interval.

> A particular confidence level of 95% calculated from an experiment does not mean that there is a 95% probability of a sample parameter from a repeat of the experiment falling within this interval.

## Stem
Your company has recruited a random sample of individuals to watch a new TV show and rate it from 1 to 5 stars. You compute a mean rating of 3.6 stars, with a 95% confidence interval of 3.2 - 4.0 stars.

Which of the following is a correct interpretation of that confidence interval (CI)?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
If you repeat the process, you expect 95% of the CIs to contain the mean population rating

## Distractors
### 1.
There is a 95% probability that this CI contains the mean population rating

### 2.
If you repeat the process, you expect this CI to contain the sample mean 95% of the time

### 3.
This CI contains the ratings of 95% of the participants in the sample

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
When interviewing on statistics, this along with p-values are the most commonly misunderstood concepts.
