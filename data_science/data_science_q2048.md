# Manipulate Discretization

## Item ID
2048

## Claim
1

## Threshold Probabilities
[0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> For naive-Bayes classifiers, numeric attributes are often preprocessed by discretization as the classification performance tends to be better when numeric attributes are discretized than when they are assumed to follow a normal distribution.

## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Which of the following models would benefit most from a preprocessing step where continuous numerical features are discretized into a fixed number of bins?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Naive Bayes

## Distractors
### 1.
Random Forest

### 2.
Multilayer Perceptron

### 3.
Support Vector Machine

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
The other three methods directly accept continuous features and discretizing the input only amounts to throwing away information.

The question is clear. I do not know enough about the substantive machine learning theory to evaluate the accuracy but it seems correct based on what I do know.
