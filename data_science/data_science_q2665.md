## Stem
Consider rolling a pair of fair 6-sided dice. A "double roll" is when the two faces show the same number. What is the expected number of rolls until a double roll appears?

36

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
The probability p of a "double roll" is 1/6. If the random variable Y is defined as the number of trials up to and including the first double roll, it follows a geometric distribution. The expectation is E[Y] = 1/p = 6.

One error would be calculating the probability of a _specific_ double roll (e.g. 1 and 1), which would have probability 1/36 and the expected number of trials would be 36. 

The other distractors are meant to throw off the intuition. The actual answer is placed at an extreme (lowest) to further distract.
