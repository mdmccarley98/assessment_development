## Claim
2

## Threshold Probabilities
[0.2, 0.32, 0.4, 0.52]

Multiple Choice

## Stem
You find a coin, and decide to flip it a fixed number of times and calculate the posterior distribution for the coin's bias using Bayesian inference. You start without any evidence to support any particular bias. Which of the following is NOT an appropriate prior distribution to use?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Beta(2, 2)

## Distractors
### 1.
Beta(1, 1)

### 2.
Beta(0, 0)

### 3.
Beta(1/2, 1/2)

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Beta(2, 2) would represent a prior of having observed the tail come up heads twice and tails twice.

## Content Review: (TB only)
I would replace "appropriate" with "appropriate, uninformative" or just "uninformative prior distribution" and delete "to use", leaving "Which of the following is NOT an appropriate, uninformative prior." The other fix would be to change the Answer Key to Beta(2,3) which is clearly biased.
