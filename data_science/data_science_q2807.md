## Stem
The following table describes two nominal variables: (1) age group and (2) preference for eating at home versus in a restaurant. Which age group would have the largest chi-square statistic in a test for independence?

| Age Group | Prefers to Eat in Restaurants | Prefers to Eat at Home |
|-----------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| 18-24     | 7                             | 13                     |
| 25-34     | 11                            | 9                      |
| 35-44     | 4                             | 16                     |
| 45-54     | 10                            | 10                     |
| 55-64     | 6                             | 14                     |
| 65-74     | 18                            | 2                      |
| 75 and up | 5                             | 15                     |

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Many statisticians do not know how to do this analysis, but a statistician with good intuition will get to the correct result. Chi-square is a sum of (Observed-Expected)^2 / (Expected) cell frequencies. Each cell makes a contribution to that chi-square. It is not necessary to do any calculations to see that the most unbalanced row will contribute most to the chi-square test of independence. In this case, every expected cell frequency is 10, which is easy for those who know.
