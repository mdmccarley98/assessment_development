# Statistical Models Correlation and Dependence

## Item ID
2036

## Claim
2

## Threshold Probabilities
[0.2, 0.3, 0.45, 0.5]

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> Formally, random variables are dependent if they do not satisfy a mathematical property of probabilistic independence.

> The most common of these is the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables (which may be present even when one variable is a nonlinear function of the other).

## Stem
Consider the functions x(t) = sin(t) and y(t) = cos(t). Which of the following describes the relationship between x and y?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
They are dependent and Pearson uncorrelated

## Distractors
### 1.
They are dependent and Pearson correlated

### 2.
They are independent and Pearson uncorrelated

### 3.
They are independent and Pearson correlated

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Dependence and correlation are easily confused. Here the Pearson correlation coefficient is zero. 
However, the dependent relationship is sin^2 t + cos^2 t = 1.
