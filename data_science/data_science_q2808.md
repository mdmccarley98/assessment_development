## Target Skill Level

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> When visually comparing a large number of means to one another, it is best to use simultaneous confidence intervals that
adjust for inflation of type one error with the implied comparisons the eye does when inspecting a graph

Multiple Choice

## Stem
Suppose you wish to compare ten independent groups of individuals using the average of a continuous outcome measure. For example, there may be ten different stores in different cities, and each store has 20 salespeople. The CEO wishes to see which stores, on average, have the most successful salespeople in terms of the total amount sold per salesperson. Your CEO wants a graph that will allow every store manager to compare their own average with the average of any other store and see if there is a significant difference in the mean salesperson success.
<br><br>
Which graph type best accomplishes this job while controlling type one error?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
A bar graph showing the mean of each store and simultaneous confidence intervals around the mean

## Distractors
### 1.
A bar graph showing the mean of each store and 2 SD above and below that mean

### 2.
A bar graph showing the median of each store and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles within that store

### 3.
A bar graph showing the mean of each store +/- standard error of that group mean

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Novices may choose option 1 or 2, in which the standard deviation is used or median and percentiles are used. More experienced data scientists may be in the habit of using an uncorrected standard error of the mean. A sophisticated data scientist will know that simultaneous confidence intervalsare needed here to balance the desire to see differences against the need to protect against type one error.
