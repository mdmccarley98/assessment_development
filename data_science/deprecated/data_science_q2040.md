## Stem
Consider a series of experiments, where in each experiment you do the following:

- Sample N values at random from a population
- Compute the sample mean as 1/N times the sum of values
- Compute the sample variance as 1/N times the sum of squared differences between each value and the sample mean.

On average, how does this sample variance computed compare to the true population variance?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
This sample variance is smaller

## Distractors
### 1.
This sample variance is larger

### 2.
This sample variance is equal

### 3.
This sample variance is equal, if the population is normally distributed 

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
The formula given is the biased sample variance - confusingly the term "sample variance" can refer to this, or the unbiased sample variance which has a factor of 1/(N-1) instead of 1/N.

I would suggest changing the sample stem to "On average, how does this sample variance as computed compare to the true population variance?"
