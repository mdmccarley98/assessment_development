## Claim
2

## Threshold Probabilities
[0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.52]

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> Note that, because of the definition of the sample mean, the sum of the residuals within a random sample is necessarily zero, and thus the residuals are necessarily not independent.

## Stem
Consider a sample of 30 values drawn from an unknown distribution. You compute the sample mean, and subtract each value from the sample mean to obtain the residuals. Which of the following is necessarily true:

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
The sum of the residuals is zero

## Distractors
### 1.
The residuals are statistically independent

### 2.
The residuals are normally distributed

### 3.
There are an equal number of positive and negative residuals

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Distractor 3 is approximately true for large N.

## Content Review: (TB only)
The question is fine as written. If you wanted to replace distractor 3, you could replace it with "At least one of the residuals is exactly zero." This does not have to be true but a novice might imagine only a scenario where it happens to be.
