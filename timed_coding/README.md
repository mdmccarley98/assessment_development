Timed Coding - Summary of Claims (WIP)
==============================

A candidate's score on this quiz indicates performance on simple coding tasks. A candidate receives a prompt and some test cases, and is asked to write a function given descriptions of the desired behavior. The candidate can select from a list of common languages for each problem. Problems on this quiz do not require any special knowledge of algorithms or data structures. Not all test cases are displayed, so functions should cover possible edge cases. The candidate's score is based on functionality, not any measure of code quality.

# Claims - Performance Indicators
==============================

-   Claim/PI 1: This candidate had trouble solving coding problems. They may struggle to write code under time pressure or may not have considered common edge cases.

-   Claim/PI 2: This candidate can solve coding problems, but make missteps or struggle to write code under time pressure. They may have solved some problems and not others, or may have some up with solutions but missed edge cases.

-   Claim/PI 3: This candidate can solve coding problems effectively. They may sometimes miss edge cases or may have struggled with some specific problems, but they can write working code to spec at a reasonable pace.

-   Claim/PI 4: This candidate is very effective at solving coding problems. Their solutions miss, at most, an occasional edge case, and are overall functionally correct.

-   Claim/PI 5: This candidate performed exceptionally well on our coding tasks, producing perfect or near-perfect solutions throughout.
