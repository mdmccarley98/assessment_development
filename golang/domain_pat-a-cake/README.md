## Claim
6. Be able to complete everyday coding tasks, particularly ones that relate to the languageâ€™s core features.

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> Sometimes, though, it's necessary to break out of a surrounding loop, not the switch, and in Go that can be accomplished by putting a label on the loop and "breaking" to that label.

The function `patACake` implements a children's nursery rhyme.

What is printed when the function is called?


## Code Snippet (optional)

	MarkWithAB
	PutInOven
)

func patACake() {
	step := Start
loop:
	for {
		fmt.Println(step)
		switch step {
		case Start:
			step = Roll
		case Roll:
			step = Pat
		case Pat:
			step = MarkWithAB
			break loop
		case MarkWithAB:
			step = PutInOven
		case PutInOven:
			fmt.Println("Baked")
			return
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("Unbaked", step)
}
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

In go, case statements do NOT fall through.

One of the main uses of labels is to give context to the break keyword inside a switch to specify which for loop should be broken.
