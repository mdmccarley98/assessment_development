When using the sync/atomic package in the go standard library, it's important to know the memory layout of a go struct.

The `header` struct below has many fields.

The alignment of the `f` field is 4, what is the `f` field's offset?


## Code Snippet (optional)
```golang
type header struct {
	a, b uint8
	c    int16
	d    uint16
	_, e byte
	f    uint32
}
```


## Answer Key
* 8

## Distractors

### 1
* 7

### 2
* 6

### 3
* 64


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
The byte alignment of these integer types is guaranteed in the go spec.

If you sum the numbers of bytes each field before `f` takes, you'll get the offset 8.

* a = 1
* b = 1
* c = 2
* d = 2
* _ = 1
* e = 1
