Multiple Choice

## Stem

You are writing a command line utility that uses the `flag` library.

What is the output when running the program like this:
```
go run main.go -count 12
```

## Code Snippet (optional)
```golang
// main.go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
)

var count = flag.Int("count", 5, "Count")

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Count", *count)
}
```

## Answer Key

```
Count 5
```


## Distractors

### 1.
```
Count 12
```

### 2.
```
Count 0
```

### 3.
```
./main.go:11:19: invalid indirect of count (type int)
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

The flags will not be parsed until `flag.Parse()` is called.  This program does not call `Parse`.
