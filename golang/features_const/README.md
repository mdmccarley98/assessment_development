# Go Features Const

## Item ID
go-features-const

## Claim
3. Understand distinguishing features of that language as opposed to others.

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> Constants in Go are just thatâ€”constant. They are created at compile time, even when defined as locals in functions, and can only be numbers, characters (runes), strings or booleans. Because of the compile-time restriction, the expressions that define them must be constant expressions, evaluatable by the compiler.

## Stem

There's a Container type that as an inner array:
```golang
type Container struct {
	Array []int
}
```

What is printed when the following program is run?

## Code Snippet (optional)

```golang
const c Container = Container{Array: []int{1}}
c.Array = []int{2, 3, 4}
fmt.Println(c.Array)
```

## Answer Key
```
./main.go:10:8: const initializer Container literal is not a constant
./main.go:11:10: cannot assign to c.Array
```

## Distractors

### 1.
```
[2 3 4]
```

### 1.
```
[1]
```

### 2.
```
./main.go:11:10: cannot assign to c.Array
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

Effective Go says: constants "[can only be numbers, characters (runes), strings or booleans](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#constants)"
