## Stem
Given a data store of events with `start` and `end` times, the task is to select the events which overlap (even partially) with a given time range.  Which query would correctly implement this?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
`end \u003e= event.start AND start \u003c= event.end`

## Distractors

### 1.
`start \u003e= event.start AND event.end \u003e= end`

### 2.
`event.start \u003c= start \u003c= end \u003c= event.end`

### 3.
`end \u003c= event.start OR start \u003e= event.end`
