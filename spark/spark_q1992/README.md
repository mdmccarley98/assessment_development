Multiple Choice

## Stem

What is a feature of Spark that has allowed it much better performance relative to Hadoop?

## Code Snippet (Optional)

```

```

## Answer Key

Storing data in memory in between stages, rather than reading and writing to/from disk

## Distractors

Separation of storage and compute

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (Optional):

### 1.

Both technologies can read from HDFS

### 2.

Both technologies can run on YARN

### 3.

Both technologies separate storage from compute -- Spark inherited this idea from Hadoop
