## Stem

For which use case is Spark BEST suited?

## Code Snippet (Optional)

```

```

## Answer Key

Processing large analytic datasets in parallel

## Distractors

### 1.

Retrieving records at millisecond latencies for OLTP operations

### 2.

Scheduling and orchestration of ETL pipelines

### 3.

Managing analytic clusters with multiple nodes

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (Optional):

### 1.

Spark is not suited for millisecond OLTP operations -- it is more suited to OLAP operations at scale

### 2.

Scheduling and orchestration is better served by a technology like Airflow

### 3.

Cluster management is better served by technologies such as YARN or Kubernetes
