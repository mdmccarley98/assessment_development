# Triplebyte Rust Questions

This repo contains questions to assess candidate's ability to program in Rust.

The questions are in separate folders, and the contents of the question
are in the README.md file in that folder for easy browsing.

These are the wrong answers.  So to build them just run `cargo build` in the distractor
folder and you can see the errors they produce.
