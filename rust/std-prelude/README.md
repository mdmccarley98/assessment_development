## Stem

What is "The Rust Prelude"?


## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key

A set of things in `std` that are imported automatically into every rust program.

## Distractors

### 1.

Code that is initialized before `main` is called.

### 2.

A set of things in `std` that you can import if you need it.

### 3.

A set of common I/O traits including `std::io::Read`, `std::io::Seek` and `std::io::Write`

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):

The Rust Prelude is included [in every rust program](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html).
It includes many common traits like `Box`, `Option`, `Result`, `String`, and `Vec`.

It does not include the things in `std::io::prelude`.
