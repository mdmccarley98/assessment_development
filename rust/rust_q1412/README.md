## Item Type
Multiple choice

## Stem
How can you define an integer to hold the number meters in a kilometer?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key

```rust
    let meters_in_kilometers: u32 = 1000;
```

## Distractors

```rust
    let meters_in_kilometers: int = 1000;
```

```rust
    let mut meters_in_kilometers: u32 = 1000;
```

```rust
    let mut meters_in_kilometers: int = 1000;
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):

The number of meters in a kilometer will never change, it is immutable.
`int` is not a rust type.
`let meters_in_kilometers = 1000;` will use `i32` implicitly and doesnâ€™t demonstrate knowledge of integer types.
