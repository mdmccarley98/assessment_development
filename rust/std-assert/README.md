## Stem

You are writing a video conferencing app.  
There is a `CameraState` type with a `calculate_total` function that returns `2`.

One of the tests is failing:

```rust
let camera = CameraState { registered: 1 };
let registered = camera.registered;
let total = camera.calculate_total();
assert!(registered == 2, "registered = {}, total = {}", registered, 1);
```

That prints the following:

```
failures:

---- example stdout ----
thread 'example' panicked at 'registered = 1, total = 1', test.rs:15:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

The test fails *as expected* because `registered` is 1, but `calculate_total()` returns 2.
But the text it is printing is wrong.

How should the `assert` part of the test be changed to make this test print the correct information?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key

```rust
assert!(registered == total, "registered = {}, total = {}", registered, total);
```
