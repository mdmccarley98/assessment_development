## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
You want to use the `rand_core` library in your project.
How do you use `cargo` to set it up?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key

* Add `rand_core` to your Cargo.toml.
```toml
[dependencies]
rand_core = "0.5"
```
* Run `cargo fetch` to download and install the crate.

## Distractors

### 1.
* Run `cargo install rand_core` to download and install the crate.

### 2.
* Run `cargo install --save-prod rand_core` to download the crate and save rand_core to your Cargo.toml's dependencies section.

### 3.
* Run `cargo vendor rand_core` to download and install the crate.


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):

### 1.
Many package managers work like this.  But the `cargo install` command is to install a binary rust crate as an executable, not a crate to use as a library.
```
error: specified package `rand_core v0.5.1` has no binaries
```

### 2.
This is the way other language's package managers work, specifically JavaScript's `npm`, but `cargo` does not work like this.

### 3.
This will create a folder called `rand_core` where all the packages in the Cargo.toml will be "vendored".  It won't install `rand_core`.
