## Stem
What is the purpose of this if statement?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```c
unsigned int i = 1;
char *x = (char*)&i;
if (*x)
{
    // ...
}
```

## Answer Key
Checking the endianness of the CPU.

## Distractors

### 1.
Checking if there're enough available memory for the program to run.

### 2.
It is a simple implementation of a locking mechanism - a mutex. If a thread changes the value of x inside the if statement, another thread that runs this code won't be able to get inside the if statement.

### 3.
It's a hint to the compiler that helps avoiding inlining - an optimization technique used by some compilers. Without the attempt to dereference x, variable i may get optimized to a static value, which may end up causing bugs in multithreading environments.
