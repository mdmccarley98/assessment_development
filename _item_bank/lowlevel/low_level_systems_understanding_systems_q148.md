## Stem
You're building a photo editing program. So far your program uses a single thread. You're considering making it multi-threaded. Which of the following statements about threads is accurate?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
If your program is CPU-bound, adding threads may make it faster on multi-core processors.

## Distractors

### 1.
Adding multiple threads will allow your program to edit multiple photos at once. Go for it!

### 2.
Threads will slow down your application. An asynchronous design is better (but might be harder to write).

### 3.
Modern operating systems use a GIL (global interpreter lock). This can limit the efficacy of multi-threading.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
NA
