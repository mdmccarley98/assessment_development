## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Suppose we want to identify novel species of fish in a certain coral reef, and have gathered tens of thousands of hours of video using underwater drones. Without any labels for the video, which of the following is the best way to identify promising sections for further analysis?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Train a LSTM to predict the next frame and pick sections with consistently high prediction error

## Distractors

### 1.
Use a pretrained convolutional object detector to select all frames containing fish

### 2.
Hire many Mechanical Turk workers to rate clips of the videos

### 3.
Train a Gaussian Mixture Model to select frames with a small log-likelihood

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
NA
