Multiple Choice

## Stem
You are creating a mobile app using HTML/Javascript that runs in a web view. However, you still need to access a few features written in native code. Which of the following is the best way to access native code from Javascript in the web view?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Register an object implemented in native code with the web view. Javascript in the web view would be able to access it.

## Distractors

### 1.
Create a local web server that provides end points that can be accessed from the web views.

### 2.
Recompile the Javascript engine to include your native functionality.

### 3.
Use interprocess communication (IPC) because the web view is sandboxed and runs in its own processes.
