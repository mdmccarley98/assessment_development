# Low Level Systems Understanding - Claims with Content and Item Specifications (WIP)
==============================

The Low Level Systems Understanding quiz assesses a candidate's understanding of how computers work at the operating system level, including low-level languages (especially the C language family), CPUs, and systems engineering. This is a specialized discipline; knowledge of it is a low priority for most business application developers.

# Claims - Performance Indicators
==============================

-   Claim/PI 1: The candidate does not display knowledge of how computers work at the operating system level. They do not understand how computers manage memory, nor how computers handle multiple programs running simultaneously.

-   Claim/PI 2: The candidate is familiar with basic aspects of memory management (e.g. C pointers) and concurrency (e.g. threads and locks). However, their knowledge is limited; they have difficulty answering follow-up questions about implementations or trade-offs between different approaches to low-level problems.

-   Claim/PI 3: The candidate is well-versed in the basics of both C memory management and concurrency. They also display the ability to reason about trade-offs between different approaches to low-level problems and troubleshoot common issues. However, they may have some difficulty creating implementations from scratch.

-   Claim/PI 4: The candidate displays a strong understanding of both C memory management and concurrency. They are comfortable reasoning about different theoretical approaches to low-level problems, and they also demonstrate the practical ability to implement and troubleshoot solutions in a low-level codebase.

-   Claim/PI 5: The candidate displays a deep and precise theoretical understanding of how computers execute code. They demonstrate extensive knowledge of low-level topics such as drivers, file systems, and operating systems. They are capable of architecting complex low-level solutions. They may have experience in embedded systems, distributed systems, or other roles working close to the metal.

**Testing is lacking? How can we incorporate testing into the claims and more questions?**

==============================

## Development Goal:
* Claim/PI 3: 10 questions
* Claim/PI 4: 10 questions
* Lacking 'Testing' questions all around

## Languages:
*	pseudo-code
*   c
*   c++
*   java
*	python
*   ruby
*   rust?

## Cognitive Model:
*	Recall -  can recall/recognize knowledge (e.g., definitions); can recall a memorized procedure to perform a task
*	Comprehend -  can comprehend/understand knowledge (e.g., how? why?); comprehend procedures to perform a task
*	Use - can use or apply knowledge in complex task; perform a task

## Content Targets:
Systems/Testing
*   operating system
*   memory management
*   pointers
*   concurrency - threads and locks
*   registers
*   simultaneous program management
*   drivers
*   file systems
*   embedded systems/devices
*   distributed systems
*   high-performance c++
