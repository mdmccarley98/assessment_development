## Stem
Which statement is true for this query, using only the sample data?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT	*
FROM	Persons AS P
WHERE	EXISTS	(
					SELECT	*
					FROM 	Vaccinations AS V 
					WHERE	V.Comments IS NULL 
							OR 
							P.Email IS NULL
				);
```

## Answer Key
It returns all persons.

## Distractors
### 1.
It returns all persons that have a comment associated with any of their vaccinations, or those with NULL emails.

### 2.
It returns an empty set.

### 3.
This query is invalid and will raise an error.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding the Answer Key, since there are vaccination rows with a NULL comment, the EXISTS evaluated to true for all rows. The OR doesn’t affect the result as there are no NULL emails, it’s the primary key.
- Regarding Distractor #1, email can’t be NULL and the EXISTS is missing the correlation between V and P.
- Regarding Distractor #2, this would be true if there were no NULL comments vaccinations, but the question explicitly states using the sample data.
- Regarding Distractor #3, the query is weird but valid.
