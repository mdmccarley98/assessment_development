The query below returns the full names of all vaccinated persons. You need to add an additional column named ‘Has Comments’ to the result that returns the value ‘Y’ for persons who have had comments associated with their vaccinations, and ‘N’ for those who haven’t. Which expression should you use?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT	P.First_Name, 
		P.Last_Name
FROM 	Persons AS P
		INNER JOIN
		Vaccinations AS V
		ON P.Email = V.Recipient
GROUP BY 	P.First_Name,
	   		P.Last_Name;
```

## Answer Key
`CASE WHEN MAX(V.Comments) IS NOT NULL THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END AS Has_Comments`

## Distractors
### 1.
`COALESCE(V.Comments, 'Y', 'N') AS Has_Comments`

### 2.
`IF (V.Comments IS NULL THEN 'N' ELSE 'Y') AS Has_Comments`

### 3.
`CASE WHEN V.Comments IS NULL THEN 'N' ELSE 'Y' END AS Has_Comments`

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding the Answer Key, comments must be encapsulated in an aggregate function as it is not part of the GROUP BY expressions.
- Regarding Distractor #1, this is a nonsense expression.
- Regarding Distractor #2, this is a nonsense expression.
- Regarding Distractor #3, V.Comments can’t be referenced directly as it is not one of the GROUP BY expressions.
