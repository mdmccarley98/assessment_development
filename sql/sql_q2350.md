## Stem
You need to write a query that reports the known work duration (based on vaccination times) per day of each nurse. Which query should you use?

## Code Snippet (optional)
N/A

## Answer Key
```SQL
SELECT  P.First_Name, P.Last_Name, 
        CAST(V.Vaccination_Time AS DATE) AS Date,
        CAST(MAX(V.Vaccination_Time) 
  - MIN(V.Vaccination_Time) AS TIME) AS Work_Duration
FROM    Persons AS P
        INNER JOIN
        Vaccinations AS V
        ON P.Email = V.Nurse
GROUP BY P.First_Name, P.Last_Name, CAST(V.Vaccination_Time AS DATE)
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; 
```

## Distractors
### 1.
```SQL
SELECT  P.First_Name, P.Last_Name,
        MAX(V.Vaccination_Time) - MIN(V.Vaccination_Time) AS Work_Duration
FROM    Persons AS P
        INNER JOIN
        Vaccinations AS V
        ON P.Email = V.Nurse
GROUP BY P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 2.
```SQL
SELECT  P.First_Name, P.Last_Name, 
        CAST(V.Vaccination_Time AS DATE) AS Date,
        MAX(V.Vaccination_Time) 
  - MIN(V.Vaccination_Time) AS Work_Duration
FROM    Persons AS P
        INNER JOIN
        Vaccinations AS V
        ON P.Email = V.Nurse
GROUP BY CAST(V.Vaccination_Time AS DATE)
HAVING MAX(V.Vaccination_Time) > MIN(V.Vaccination_Time);
```

### 3.
```SQL
SELECT  P.First_Name, P.Last_Name, 
        V.Vaccination_Time,
        MAX(V.Vaccination_Time) - MIN(V.Vaccination_Time) AS Work_Duration
FROM    Persons AS P
        INNER JOIN
        Vaccinations AS V
        ON P.Email = V.Nurse
GROUP BY P.First_Name, P.Last_Name, V.Vaccination_Time
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding Distractor #1, vaccination time must be converted to date and grouped by.
- Regarding Distractor #2, this query is invalid as name is not a grouping expression.
- Regarding Distractor #3, grouping by vaccination time and using aggregate functions on it is meaningless.
