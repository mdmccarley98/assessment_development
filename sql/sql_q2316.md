What will be the result of attempting to execute this query?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT  DISTINCT Site
FROM    Vaccinations AS V
		INNER JOIN 
		Vaccination_Sites AS VS
		ON V.Site = VS.Site
WHERE   VS.State = 'California'
		AND 
		VS.City = 'San Francisco'
		AND 
		V.Vaccine = 'Pfizer';
```

## Answer Key
A binding error will be raised because Site is an ambiguous expression.

## Distractors
### 1.
It returns one row for each site in San Francisco, California, where Pfizer vaccines have been administered.

### 2.
It returns one row for each vaccination site in San Francisco, California where only Pfizer vaccines have been administered.

### 3.
It returns a row for each Pfizer vaccination that took place in San Francisco, California.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Site exists in both joined tables and the SELECT list fails to qualify it.
- Distractor #1 would be the answer if the select list expression would have qualified site.
