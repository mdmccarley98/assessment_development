Multiple Choice

## Stem
What will be the result of attempting to execute this query? 

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
DELETE	FROM Persons 
WHERE 	Last_Name = 'Bo';
```

## Answer Key
No rows will be affected.

## Distractors
### 1.
Jim Bo’s row will be deleted from the Persons table.

### 2.
Jim Bo’s rows will be deleted from both the Persons and Vaccinations tables.

### 3.
This query is invalid and will result in a syntax error.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- By default, foreign keys assume the no action referential action for updates.
- The delete violates the foreign key constraint and Jim’s rows can’t be deleted.
- Although there is a cascade option for foreign keys which will result in rows being deleted from both tables, it is not the default.
- The query is syntactically valid. Some databases such as SQL Server treat no action as restrict and will raise an error, but it will be a constraint violation, not a syntax error.
