This query takes too long to execute. What will you do to improve its performance?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT  First_Name, Last_Name
FROM    Persons
WHERE   Date_of_Birth > CAST('1995-01-01' AS DATE);
```

## Answer Key
`CREATE INDEX IDX ON Persons(Date_of_Birth, First_Name, Last_Name)`

## Distractors
### 1.
Replace the expression `Date_of_Birth` with `CAST(Date_of_Birth AS DATE)` to avoid type conversions.

### 2.
`CREATE INDEX IDX ON Persons(First_Name, Last_Name, Date_of_Birth)`

### 3.
Create a view that consists of this query with the actual date of birth as an input parameter.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding Distractor #1, Date of Birth is already a DATE type.
- Regarding Distractor #2, although this index covers the query, it doesnâ€™t support the filter for date of birth.
- Regarding Distractor #3, views do not support parameters.
