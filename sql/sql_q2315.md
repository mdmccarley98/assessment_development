## Stem
What will be the result of attempting to execute this query?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
DELETE FROM Persons
WHERE First_Name = Maria;
```

## Answer Key
A binding error will be raised as there is no column named Maria in the Persons table.

## Distractors
### 1.
Mariaâ€™s row will be deleted from the Persons table.

### 2.
No rows will be affected.

This query is invalid and will result in a syntax error.

- The query will fail to execute due to a binding error.
- The query is syntactically correct.
