Which query will return the city (or cities) where the most vaccinations were administered?

## Code Snippet (optional)
N/A

## Answer Key
```SQL
WITH City_Vaccination_Counts
AS
(
SELECT  VS.City, VS.State, COUNT(*) AS Vaccinations
FROM    Vaccination_Sites AS VS 
        INNER JOIN 
        Vaccinations AS V 
        ON V.Site = VS.Site
GROUP BY VS.City, VS.State
)
SELECT  * 
FROM    City_Vaccination_Counts AS VC 
WHERE   Vaccinations =  (
                        	SELECT  MAX(Vaccinations)
                        	FROM    City_Vaccination_Counts
                        );
```

## Distractors
### 1.
```SQL
SELECT  VS.City, VS.State
FROM    Vaccination_Sites AS VS 
        INNER JOIN 
        Vaccinations AS V 
        ON V.Site = VS.Site
GROUP BY VS.City, VS.State
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 1 ROW ONLY; -- (IEC/ISO syntax equivalent to LIMIT 1)
```

### 2.
```SQL
SELECT  VS.City, VS.State, COUNT(*) AS Vaccinations
FROM    Vaccination_Sites AS VS 
        INNER JOIN 
        Vaccinations AS V 
        ON V.Site = VS.Site
GROUP BY VS.City, VS.State
HAVING  COUNT(*) = MAX(COUNT(*));
```

### 3.
```SQL
WITH City_Vaccination_Counts
AS
(
SELECT  VS.City, VS.State, COUNT(*) AS Vaccinations
FROM    Vaccination_Sites AS VS 
        INNER JOIN 
        Vaccinations AS V 
        ON V.Site = VS.Site
GROUP BY VS.City, VS.State
)
SELECT  * 
FROM    City_Vaccination_Counts AS VC 
WHERE   EXISTS  (
                    SELECT  NULL
                    FROM    City_Vaccination_Counts AS VC2 
                    WHERE   VC.Vaccinations < VC2.Vaccinations
                );
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding the Answer Key, we must reference the counts twice â€“ once to get the max, and then to filter cities that equal the max.
- Regarding Distractor #1, this query returns only 1 city even if there is a tie for first place.
- Regarding Distractor #3, this will return the city with the lowest number of vaccinations.
