## Stem
This query returns the number of vaccinations administered per day in each site. You need to add an expression to the select list that calculates the total number of vaccines administered at that site up to the current day (running total). Which expression will you use?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT  Site, 
		CAST(Vaccination_Time AS DATE) AS Vaccination_Date, 
		COUNT(*) AS Number_Of_Vaccinations
FROM    Vaccinations
GROUP BY Site, CAST(Vaccination_Time AS DATE)
ORDER BY Site ASC, Vaccination_Date ASC;
```

## Answer Key
```SQL
SUM(COUNT(*)) 
OVER	(   PARTITION BY Site 
		  	ORDER BY CAST(Vaccination_Time AS DATE) ASC 
		  	ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
	   	) AS Total_Vaccinations_Up_to_Date
```

## Distractors
### 1.
```SQL
SUM(Number_Of_Vaccinations) 
OVER	(   PARTITION BY Site 
		  	ORDER BY CAST(Vaccination_Time AS DATE) ASC 
		  	ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
		) AS Total_Vaccinations_Up_to_Date
```

### 2.
```SQL
SUM(COUNT(*))
OVER	(   PARTITION BY CAST(Vaccination_Time AS DATE) 
		  	ORDER BY CAST(Vaccination_Time AS DATE) ASC 
		  	ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
		) AS Total_Vaccinations_Up_to_Date
```

### 3.
```SQL
SUM(COUNT(*))
OVER	(   ORDER BY CAST(Vaccination_Time AS DATE) ASC 
		  	RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 ROW PRECEDING
	   	) AS Total_Vaccinations_Up_to_Date
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding Distractor #1, Number_Of_Vaccinations can’t be referenced in the same select list.
- Regarding Distractor #2, the partition should by site, not by date.
- Regarding Distractor #3, missing ‘per site’ partition and frame boundaries are wrong.
