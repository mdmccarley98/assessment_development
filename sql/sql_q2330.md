## Stem
Dianne Wilder married and changed her last name to Jackson and her email to dianne_jackson99@yahoo.com. You need to update the database to reflect her new name and email. What set of queries should you use, ensuring that it will work correctly with future data as well?

## Code Snippet (optional)
N/A

## Answer Key
```SQL
INSERT INTO Persons (Email, First_Name, Last_Name, Date_of_Birth, Sex)
VALUES ('dianne_jackson99@yahoo.com', 'Dianne', 'Jackson' , '2001-01-29', 'F');

UPDATE Vaccinations 
SET 	Recipient = 'dianne_jackson99@yahoo.com'
WHERE 	Recipient = 'wild_one99@yahoo.com';

DELETE	FROM Persons 
WHERE	Email = 'wild_one99@yahoo.com';
```

## Distractors
### 1.
```SQL
UPDATE	Persons
SET 	Email = 'dianne_jackson99@yahoo.com', 
		Last_Name = 'Jackson' 
WHERE 	Email = 'wild_one99@yahoo.com';

UPDATE	Vaccinations
SET 	Recipient = 'dianne_jackson99@yahoo.com'
WHERE 	Recipient = 'wild_one99@yahoo.com';
```

### 2.
```SQL
UPDATE	Vaccinations 
SET 	Recipient = 'dianne_jackson99@yahoo.com'
WHERE 	Recipient = 'wild_one99@yahoo.com';

UPDATE	Persons 
SET 	Email = 'dianne_jackson99@yahoo.com', 
		Last_Name = 'Jackson'
WHERE 	Email = 'wild_one99@yahoo.com';
```

### 3.
```SQL
DELETE	FROM Vaccinations
WHERE 	Recipient = 'wild_one99@yahoo.com';

UPDATE	Persons 
SET 	Email = 'dianne_jackson99@yahoo.com',
		Last_Name = 'Jackson'
WHERE Email = 'wild_one99@yahoo.com';

INSERT INTO Vaccinations (Recipient, Vaccination_Time, Vaccine, Site, Nurse, Batch, Comments)
VALUES ('dianne_jackson99@yahoo.com', '2021-12-14T13:09:00', 'Moderna', 'NE Market', 'sveta123@hotmail.com', 'Q312-S0003-38910', NULL);
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding the Answer Key, this is the only way that will preserve all vaccinations for Dianne. A better alternative is to define the foreign key as ON UPDATE CASCADE, but that is an advanced option. Perhaps a question in the advanced exam is in place as a follow up to this one.
- Regarding the Distractor #1, the first query will fail to update her row as the foreign key constraint will be violated, and the default for foreign key updates is no action. Therefore, the second query will violate the foreign key and fail with a constraint violation error.
- Regarding the Distractor #2, the first query will violate the foreign key constraint and the second query will follow.
- Regarding the Distractor #3, while this will work with the sample data, if Dianne has more than one vaccination row it will be deleted for good.
