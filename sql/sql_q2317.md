You need to find how many persons with the last name Lee we have in our database. Which of these queries will you use?

## Code Snippet (optional)
N/A

## Answer Key
```SQL
SELECT	COUNT(*) 
FROM 	Persons
WHERE 	Last_Name = 'Lee';
```

## Distractors
### 1.
```SQL
SELECT	COUNT(*)
FROM	Persons 
WHERE	Last_Name = 'Lee'
GROUP BY Email;
```

### 2.
```SQL
SELECT	COUNT(*) 
FROM 	Persons 
GROUP BY Last_Name = 'Lee';
```

### 3.
```SQL
SELECT	COUNT(*)
FROM	Persons
HAVING	Last_Name = 'Lee';
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Theoretically, it should have a GROUP BY () but all RDBMS that I know of donâ€™t require grouping by an empty set and will treat the whole set of rows with Lee as last name as a single group.
- On Distractor #1, Email is the primary key of Persons so this query will return 2 rows with the value of 1 for each.
- Distractor #2 is syntactically invalid. GROUP BY does not accept predicates.
- On Distractor #3, without a GROUP BY the table is treated as a single group and therefore referencing Last Name is invalid.
