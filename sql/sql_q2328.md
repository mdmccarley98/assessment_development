## Stem
You’ve been asked to add database support for tracking working hours for nurses. For each nurse, you need to track the time they started and ended their workday and at which site. A nurse can work the morning shift at one site and the evening shift at another. Which of the following solutions will you use?

## Code Snippet (optional)
N/A

## Answer Key
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Nurses_Work_Log 
(	Nurse	VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL REFERENCES Nurses(Email),
 	Date 	DATE NOT NULL,
	Site	VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL REFERENCES Vaccination_Sites(Site),
	Started 	TIME NOT NULL,
	Ended		TIME NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (Nurse, Date. Site),
	CHECK (Ended > Started)
);
```

## Distractors
### 1.
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Nurses_Work_Log 
(	Nurse	VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL 
			REFERENCES Nurses(Email),
 	Date 	DATE NOT NULL,
	Site	VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL 
			REFERENCES Vaccination_Sites(Site),
	Started 	TIME NULL,
	Ended		TIME NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (Nurse, Date)
);
```

### 2.
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Nurses_Work_Log 
(	Nurse	VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
 	Date 	DATE 		NOT NULL,
	Site	VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	Started 	TIME 	NULL,
	Ended		TIME 	NULL
);
```

### 3.
```SQL
ALTER TABLE Nurses ADD COLUMN 
	Site	VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	Date	DATE NOT NULL,
	Started 	TIME NULL,
	Ended		TIME NULL;
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding the Answer Key, the key is important so we must separate day from time. Candidates should realize that the check constraint will allow NULL for the Ended column during the day.
- Regarding Distractor #1, PK of Nurse and Site will not allow the same nurse to work at more than one site on the same day. Also, NULL for Started is not a good practice as it will allow for rows without a start time.
- Regarding Distractor #2, data type mismatch for nurse and no keys.
- Regarding Distractor #3, the Nurses table stores only nurses’ data, a work log is a separate entity.
