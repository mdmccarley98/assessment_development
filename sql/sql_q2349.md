## Stem
The following query takes too long to execute. What will you do to improve its performance?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT  VS.City, COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Vaccinations
FROM    Vaccinations AS V 
		INNER JOIN 
		Vaccination_Sites AS VS
		ON V.Site = VS.Site
WHERE   VS.State = 'California'
GROUP BY VS.City;
```

## Answer Key
```SQL
CREATE INDEX IDX1 ON Vaccinations(Site);
CREATE INDEX IDX2 ON Vaccination_Sites(State, City, Site); 
```

## Distractors
### 1.
```SQL
CREATE INDEX IDX ON Vaccinations(Site, State, City);
```

### 2.
Replace the `INNER JOIN` with a subquery.

### 3.
Create a view that joins Vaccinations and Vaccination_Sites. Replace the `FROM` clause to select from that view.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding the Answer Key, IDX1 will help facilitate the join, IDX2 will optimize the WHERE filter, the join, and the GROUP BY.
- Regarding Distractor #1, State and City are not in Vaccinations.
- Regarding Distractor #2, the underlying work will be the same regardless of syntax.
- Regarding Distractor #3, the view by itself doesnâ€™t provide any performance benefits.
