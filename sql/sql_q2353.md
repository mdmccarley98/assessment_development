		OVER (PARTITION BY Recipient ORDER BY Vaccination_Time ASC) 
			AS Previous_Vaccination_Time,

FROM    Vaccinations
)
SELECT  DISTINCT P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
FROM    Persons AS P
		INNER JOIN 
		Previous_Vaccinations AS PV
		ON P.Email = PV.Recipient
WHERE   PV.Vaccine <> PV.Previous_Vaccination
		AND
		Vaccination_Time - Previous_Vaccination_Time <= INTERVAL '3' Months
		/* SQL Server syntax for last row is:
		DATEDIFF(MONTH, Previous_Vaccination_Time, Vaccination_Time) <= 3
		*/
```

### 3.
