What will be the result of attempting to execute this query?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT  DISTINCT SV.Site
FROM    Vaccinations AS V
		INNER JOIN 
		Vaccination_Sites AS SV
		ON V.Site = SV.Site
WHERE   CAST(V.Vaccination_Time AS TIME) NOT BETWEEN SV.Opens AND SV.Closes;
```

## Answer Key
It returns one row per vaccination site where at least one vaccination took place outside normal operating hours.

## Distractors
### 1.
This statement is invalid as the NOT BETWEEN uses incompatible data types.

### 2.
It returns one row for each vaccination that took place outside normal operating hours.

### 3.
It returns all vaccination sites which never had any vaccines administered during normal operation hours.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding Distractor #1, the CAST explicitly converts to the correct types.
