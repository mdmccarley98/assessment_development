## Stem
You need to write a query that counts how many vaccines from each provider have been administered by each state. When you attempt to execute this query, you get an error that V.Vaccine is invalid in the SELECT list. What changes will you make for this query to return the correct result?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT  VS.State, V.Vaccine, COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Vaccinations
FROM    Vaccinations AS V
        INNER JOIN 
        Vaccination_Sites AS VS
        ON V.Site = VS.Site
GROUP BY State;
```

## Answer Key
Add V.Vaccine to the GROUP BY expressions: `GROUP BY State, V.Vaccine`.

## Distractors
### 1.
Add the alias VS to the GROUP BY expression: `GROUP BY VS.State`.

### 2.
Remove V.Vaccine from the SELECT list.

### 3.
Remove the GROUP BY clause.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding Distractor #1, State is non ambiguous to begin with.
- Regarding Distractor #2, while this will make the query run, it will return the total number of vaccinations per state, not per provider.
