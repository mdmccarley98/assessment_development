## Answer Key

Analytic and window functions are synonymous in SQL

## Distractors

### 1.

Analytic functions are optimized for analytical use cases with data from a single row, whereas window functions extend that functionality across multiple rows by using windows

### 2.

Analytic functions are scalar functions, while window functions are non-scalar functions

### 3.

Analytic functions are used to perform common analytical tasks such as calculating moving averages, while window functions are used to get insights about database performance
