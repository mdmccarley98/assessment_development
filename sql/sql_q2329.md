Which query returns all persons who were vaccinated only once and had no comments associated with that vaccination?

## Code Snippet (optional)
N/A

## Answer Key
```SQL
SELECT	P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
FROM	Persons AS P
		INNER JOIN 
		Vaccinations AS V 
		ON P.Email = V.Recipient
GROUP BY P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
HAVING  COUNT(*) = 1 
		AND 
		MAX(V.Comments) IS NULL;
```

## Distractors
### 1.
```SQL
SELECT	P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
FROM	Persons AS P
		INNER JOIN 
		Vaccinations AS V 
		ON P.Email = V.Recipient
WHERE	V.Comments IS NULL
GROUP BY P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
HAVING	COUNT(*) = 1;
```

### 2.
```SQL
SELECT	P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
FROM	Persons AS P
WHERE	1 =  (
				SELECT  COUNT(*) 
				FROM    Vaccinations AS V 
				WHERE   V.Recipient = P.Email 
						AND 
						V.Comments IS NULL
			 );
```

### 3.
```SQL
SELECT	P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
FROM	Persons AS P
WHERE	EXISTS  (
					SELECT	NULL 
					FROM	Vaccinations AS V
					WHERE	V.Recipient = P.Email 
							AND
							V.Comments IS NULL
				)
		AND NOT EXISTS 
				(
					SELECT  NULL 
					FROM    Vaccinations AS V
					WHERE   V.Recipient = P.Email 
							AND
							V.Comments IS NOT NULL
				);
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding the Answer Key, the MAX is a dummy aggregate that returns a non-null value if that person had any comment associated with their vaccination.
- Regarding Distractor #1, this query returns persons who had 1 vaccination without comments, regardless of other vaccinations they may have had.
- Regarding Distractor #2, this query returns persons who had 1 vaccination without comments, regardless of other vaccinations they may have had.
- Regarding Distractor #3, this query returns persons who were vaccinated more than once as well.
