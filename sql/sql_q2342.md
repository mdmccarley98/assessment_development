This query returns the number of vaccinations administered per day in each site. The query takes too long to execute and you need to add an index to improve the query’s performance. Which of these indexes will you use?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT  Site, 
        CAST(Vaccination_Time AS DATE) AS Vaccination_Date, 
        COUNT(*) AS Number_Of_Vaccinations
FROM    Vaccinations
GROUP BY Site, CAST(Vaccination_Time AS DATE)
ORDER BY Site ASC, Vaccination_Date ASC;
```

## Answer Key
`CREATE INDEX IDX ON Vaccinations (Site, Vaccination_Time);`

## Distractors
### 1.
`CREATE INDEX IDX ON Vaccinations (Site);`

### 2.
`CREATE INDEX IDX ON Vaccinations (Vaccination_Time);`

### 3.
`CREATE INDEX IDX ON Vaccinations (Vaccination_Time, Site);`

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding the Answer Key, site as a leading column will allow efficient grouping and ordering. Including vaccination time will make the index cover the query.
- Regarding Distractor #1, although it will improve performance, it is not covering so will require lookups.
- Regarding Distractor #2, vaccination time by itself doesn’t support this query.
- Regarding Distractor #3, although this index may be scanned as it is covering, it doesn’t support the query’s grouping or ordering.
