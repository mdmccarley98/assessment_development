## Code Snippet (optional)
N/A

## Answer Key
```SQL
WITH Nurse_Hours AS 
(
SELECT  Nurse,
		MIN(CAST(Vaccination_Time AS TIME)) AS Earliest,
		MAX(CAST(Vaccination_Time AS TIME)) AS Latest
FROM    Vaccinations
GROUP BY Nurse
)
SELECT  P.First_Name, P.Last_Name, NH.Earliest, NH.Latest
FROM    Persons AS P
		INNER JOIN 
		Nurse_Hours AS NH 
		ON P.Email = NH.Nurse
WHERE   NH.Latest = (SELECT MAX(Latest) FROM Nurse_Hours)
		OR 
		NH.Earliest = (SELECT MIN(Earliest) FROM Nurse_Hours);
```

## Distractors
### 1.
```SQL
WITH Nurse_Hours AS 
(
SELECT  Nurse,
		MIN(Vaccination_Time) AS Earliest,
		MAX(Vaccination_Time) AS Latest
FROM    Vaccinations
GROUP BY Nurse
)
SELECT  P.First_Name, P.Last_Name, NH.Earliest, NH.Latest
FROM    Persons AS P
		INNER JOIN 
		Nurse_Hours AS NH 
		ON P.Email = NH.Nurse
WHERE   NH.Latest = MAX(Latest)
		OR 
		NH.Earliest = MIN(Earliest);
```

### 2.
```SQL
SELECT	P.First_Name, P.Last_Name, 
MIN(CAST(Vaccination_Time AS TIME)) AS Earliest, 
MAX(CAST(Vaccination_Time AS TIME)) AS Latest
FROM    Persons AS P
		INNER JOIN 
		Nurse_Hours AS NH 
		ON P.Email = NH.Nurse
GROUP BY P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
HAVING	  CAST(Vaccination_Time AS TIME) = MAX(CAST(Vaccination_Time AS TIME))
	  	  OR 
	  	  CAST(Vaccination_Time AS TIME) = MIN(CAST(Vaccination_Time AS TIME));
```

### 3.
```SQL
SELECT  P.First_Name, P.Last_Name, 
		MIN(CAST(V.Vaccination_Time AS TIME)) AS Earliest,
		MAX(CAST(V.Vaccination_Time AS TIME)) AS Latest
FROM    Persons AS P 
		INNER JOIN 
		Vaccinations AS V 
		ON P.Email = V.Recipient
GROUP BY P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
HAVING  CAST(V.Vaccination_Time AS TIME) IN  
 		( 	MIN(CAST(Vaccination_Time AS TIME)), 
   		  	MAX(CAST(Vaccination_Time AS TIME))
		);
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding Distractor #1, earliest and latest here include date and not just time of day and MAX/MIN can’t be used in the WHERE clause.
- Regarding Distractor #2, the HAVING clause can’t reference Vaccination time without an aggregate function as it is not part of the group by clause.
- Regarding Distractor #3, vaccination time can’t be used in the HAVING clause without an aggregate function.
