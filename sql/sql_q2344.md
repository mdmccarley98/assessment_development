## Stem
This query returns all female nurses who work at more than one site. The query takes too long to execute. You need to add two indexes to improve the query’s performance. Which of these indexes are best to support this query?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT  P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
FROM    Persons AS P
		INNER JOIN 
		Nurses AS N 
		ON P.Email = N.Email
		INNER JOIN 
		Vaccinations AS V
		ON V.Nurse = N.Email
WHERE   P.Sex = 'F'
GROUP BY P.First_Name, P.Last_Name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT V.Site) > 1;
```

## Answer Key
```SQL
CREATE INDEX IDX1 ON Vaccinations (Nurse, Site);
CREATE INDEX IDX2 ON Persons (Sex, Email, First_Name, Last_Name);
```

## Distractors
### 1.
```SQL
CREATE INDEX IDX1 ON Vaccinations (Site, Nurse);
CREATE INDEX IDX2 ON Persons (Email, First_Name, Last_Name);
```

### 2.
```SQL
CREATE INDEX IDX1 ON Vaccinations (Nurse);
CREATE INDEX IDX2 ON Persons (Sex, First_Name, Last_Name);
```

### 3.
```SQL
CREATE INDEX IDX1 ON Nurses (Email);
CREATE INDEX IDX2 ON Persons (First_Name, Last_Name, Sex);
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding the Answer Key, the first index supports the join and the count distinct, the second supports the filter on Persons for females.
- Regarding Distractor #1, site as a leading column doesn’t support the join, Email is already indexed in persons as it is the primary key.
- Regarding Distractor #2, these indexes don’t cover the query.
- Regarding Distractor #3, email in Nurses is already indexed as it is the primary key. First name and last name as leading columns do not support joins or filters.
