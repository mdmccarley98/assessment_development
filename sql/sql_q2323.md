## Stem
The query below takes too long to execute. What will you do to improve this query’s performance best? _Note: don’t consider other queries or a holistic indexing strategy. Focus on this query only._

## Code Snippet (optional)
```SQL
SELECT	Recipient, Nurse 
FROM 	Vaccinations 
WHERE 	Vaccine = 'Pfizer ' AND Site = 'NE Market ';
```

## Answer Key
Create a composite index on the Vaccinations table for the Vaccine, Site, Recipient, and Nurse columns.

## Distractors
### 1.
Create two single-column indexes on the Vaccination table. One on the Vaccine column, and the other on the Site column.

### 2.
Create two indexes on the Vaccinations table. One single column on Vaccine, and a composite index on the Site, Recipient, and Nurse columns.

### 3.
Create four single-column indexes on the vaccination table. One for each of the Vaccine, Site, Recipient, and Nurse columns.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Regarding the Answer Key, this index will allow filtering for both WHERE predicates and will cover the query.
- Regarding Distractor #1, these indexes, while may be used by the database engine are not covering and will require lookups.
