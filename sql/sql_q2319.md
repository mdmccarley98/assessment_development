## Answer Key
Bruce Lee may be sorted before or after Chen Lee.

## Distractors
### 1.
Bruce Lee will be sorted before Chen Lee.

### 2.
Maria Chadwick will be sorted before Svetlana Bulova.

### 3.
This query is invalid and will raise an error as there are more than 1 person with the last name Lee.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- The query is nondeterministic and either sorting is valid.
- Sorting is by last name only so first name has no impact.
