## Stem
In React, what is a portal?

## Code Snippet

## Answer Key
A portal is a way of rendering React components into DOM nodes that are outside of the DOM hierarchy of the root React application.

## Distractors
### 1.
A portal is a way of passing state between components to avoid "prop drilling".

### 2.
A portal is a type of display component that allows a user to quickly navigate to different parts of an application.

### 3.
Portals are a way of safely composing queries into deeply nested data.


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):

* While the use of portals is not common in "greenfield" applications, they are very useful for incrementally migrating a legacy app to React, or to include a few minor React components into a content-based static site.
