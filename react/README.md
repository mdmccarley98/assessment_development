# React - Summary of Claims (WIP)

## Claims

- Claim 1 (core_concepts): Define elements, components, events, and props using the JSX syntax. Understand how Virtual DOM and diffing work.
- Claim 2 (state): Understand React's state model. Create and manipulate React state correctly. Replace ReaReact'scycle methods with hooks.
- Claim 3 (profiling_and_performance): Profile the resource usage of a React app. Understand common performance issues and the appropriate solutions.

## Definition of Scores

Candidates with the following scores demonstrate the associated understanding and abilities:

1. Is unfamiliar with React or only demonstrates a superficial understanding of components.
2. Can write and use basic components, as long as they do not require advanced state management. Understands the concept of uni-directional data flow but may struggle to solve real-world problems within this paradigm.
3. Has a working knowledge of component composition. Has a basic understanding of functional state management, common APIs, and third-party libraries. Can use hooks but may not understand effect-handling well enough to write non-trivial custom hooks.
4. Has a strong knowledge of functional state management, including proper handling of side effects in various situations, including reducer-based state management architectures and custom hooks.
5. Has an expert-level understanding of performance optimization, state management, side-effect handling, and component composition.
