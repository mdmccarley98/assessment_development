## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> This library is a replacement for Enzyme. While you can follow these guidelines using Enzyme itself, enforcing this is harder because of all the extra utilities that Enzyme provides
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - testing-library.com

> Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output. You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output.
- [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) - enzymejs.github.io

> Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

Multiple Choice

## Stem
For testing your React web client, you will want to use at least a couple of testing libraries that serve different purposes.  At a bare minimum, you will need a test runner and a way of defining the expectations of the React component under test.  Optionally, you might also want a general-purpose assertion library.  Choose the stack of testing libraries that meets these needs.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):

* In the batteries-not-included world of Javascript, it is usually going to require multiple testing dependencies to construct a complete testing environment.
* React Testing Library and Enzyme are alternatives to each other that follow different philosophies of testing components.  So it would only make sense during a transition from one to the other that a team would have both in their testing stack.  Also, neither can run tests.
* Jest and Jasmine mostly overlap in functionality as test runners.  So they are not particularly compatible with each other.
* Chai is an assertion library that supports classical TDD and BDD assertion styles.
