### Growth Team Task

#### Entry-level (junior) engineer questions.

Target population for questions: bootcamp grads, entry-level engineers, 0-1yrs experience
Difficulty: *(really) easy*
Goal: Show questions in email campains that are engaging and confidence-boosting; qusetions that will get entry-level engineers to want to take the quiz

Our growth team would like some **really easy** questions to use in emailing that are focused around the topics of:

| *Academic CS* |
| --- | 
| Academic CS covers knowledge of the CS theory covered in typical CS education programs. It includes `algorithms` and `data structures`, `time and space complexity` and `big-O notation`, and the actual mechanics by which computers operate. This is a good thing to know for the sake of precise engineering, and it's also something many employers heavily emphasize in their interview processes. |


| *Programmatic problem solving* |
| --- |
| Programmatic problem solving represents your comfort analyzing the structure of code to understand its flow and intended purpose. For example, if a line is missing from a function, it's often possible to recognize what is missing by looking at surrounding logic. This skill is valuable to almost everyone, especially when working with legacy code or debugging. |

| *Frontend knowledge* |
| --- | 
| Frontend, for our purposes, means web development within a web page loaded in a user's browser. Important topics include `JavaScript` and its `major libraries`, `CSS`, `HTTP`, and `event-driven programming`. This field tends to attract engineers excited by the product they can create, who want to see users interacting with their creation directly. |


***Target: 2-3 questions per topic.***

### Ads Team Task

#### Questions for general ads (broader engineering population)

Target population for questions: broader population of engineers
Our Ads team would like some **easy-to-medium difficulty (engaging)** questions to use in ads. An example of how a question is used in advertisements is posted in the [example folder](./examples/). 
Goal: To use in various email/Reddit/Facebook campaigns that will encourage developers and maybe find the content engaging enough to want to attempt an assessment.

Our ads team would like some **easy-to-medium difficulty (engaging)** questions to use in campaigns that are focused around the topics of:

***Target: 3-5 questions in total.***

But topics may include:

| *Backend web* |
| --- | 
| Backend web, for our purposes, means web development on the server side, not in a user's browser. Important topics include databases, HTTP, authentication, and API creation. This is a very broad field that encompasses a large percentage of engineering jobs, and it's a good place to start if you want to maximize your chances of finding work. |

| *System architecture* |
| --- | 
| System architecture is the subfield of engineering that focuses on tying together many mostly-separate components into a single application. The common database/web-server/client divide is one common architecture pattern, for example. Architecture skills are particularly important for senior engineers and tech leads, since they're expected to take charge of development at a high level. |

| *Mobile architecture* |
| --- | 
| Mobile architecture focuses on architecture patterns - common structures used by most apps unless there's some reason to deviate. Examples include the MVC (model-view-controller) pattern officially recommended by Apple for iOS development, along with other approaches like MVVM. This is a useful thing for all mobile developers to understand, but is especially important for senior engineers and tech leads. |

| *Android knowledge* |
| --- | 
| Android knowledge covers the details of the Android platform, as distinct from general-purpose software engineering. Common topics include major APIs and UI components, data persistence, and tools and approaches for performance troubleshooting. Android developers need at least intermediate knowledge of this subject, since so much of mobile development depends on understanding of the platform itself. |

| *iOS knowledge* |
| --- | 
| iOS knowledge covers the details of the iOS platform, as distinct from general-purpose software engineering. Common topics include major APIs and UI components, data persistence, and tools and approaches for performance troubleshooting. iOS developers need at least intermediate knowledge of this subject, since so much of mobile development depends on understanding of the platform itself. |

| *Machine Learning* |
| --- | 
| Machine learning understanding covers knowledge of both the theory behind ML and the pitfalls and trade-offs involved with implementing ML systems in practice. Important topics include different types of ML model (neural network, random forest, k-nearest-neighbors) and their advantages and disadvantages, methods to avoid common failure modes like overfitting, and the underlying math that makes ML possible. Both theory and practical pragmatism are important for ML engineers of any seniority. |

| *DevOps* |
| --- | 
| DevOps covers a wide and 'fuzzy' range of topics, from cloud infrastructure to performance troubleshooting to containerization. There are too many examples to cover them all here, but a few example topics include *nix command line tools; platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure; orchestration tools like Kubernetes; and infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform. Few DevOps engineers are experts at everything suggested by that title; engineers looking to transition into DevOps may benefit from picking one or two of these topics and focusing heavily on them. |

| *Low-level systems* |
| --- | 
| Low-level systems covers programming at the operating system level. It involves technical details that are often handled automatically in high-level languages, like pointer handling, concurrency, and explicit memory management. C and C++ are the traditional languages for most low-level development, though alternatives like Rust have become more popular. This is a specialized discipline and is a common area of weakness for everyday application developers; typical low- level programming jobs include low-latency financial trading software, game engines, and some forms of security engineering. |
