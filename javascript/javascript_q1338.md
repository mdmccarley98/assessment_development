## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
This code does not throw an error, even though a variable is not explicitly declared. Which of these actions will make this code throw a Javascript reference error?

## Code Snippet

```javascript
    let green;
    grnee = false;
    console.log(grnee);
```

## Answer Key
Add "use strict" to the top of this code.

## Distractors

### 1.
Put this code inside of a try-catch statement.

### 2.
Compile this code into ES5 syntax.

### 3.
Use a linter that disallows use of undeclared variables.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):
The linter will throw an error but itâ€™s a linter error, not a Javascript error. The other two distractors will not throw an error that does not already exist.
