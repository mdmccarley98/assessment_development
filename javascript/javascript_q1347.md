## Stem
What is a commonly claimed best-practice for writing unit tests?

## Code Snippet


## Answer Key
Stub backend API calls that are outside the scope of your tests to avoid false positives.

## Distractors

### 1.
Put similar assertion statements in a loop where possible to keep unit tests concise.

### 2.
Focus on implementation details, not just output behavior.

### 3.
Test heavily on expected user input, not edge cases that represent the minority of input.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):
The distractors are all bad testing habits.
