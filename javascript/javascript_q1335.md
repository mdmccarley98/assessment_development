Which of the following descriptions is true of an application that uses full server-side rendering (SSR) as opposed to client-side rendering (CSR)?

## Code Snippet


## Answer Key

Initial page load will render all the page data

## Distractors

### 1.
Subsequent page loads will be significantly faster after the initial page load.

### 2.
Initial page load does not deliver all SEO required elements.

### 3.
