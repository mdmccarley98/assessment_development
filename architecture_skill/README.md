# Architecture Skills - Claims with Content and Item Specifications (WIP)
==============================

The Architecture Skills quiz assesses a candidate's understanding of full-stack architecture principles. It includes general knowledge of modern back-end web technologies, front-end architectural components, front-end build pipelines, and a candidate's ability to organize them to create a larger application. Topics on this quiz contain questions that range from simple MVP designs to complex performance and deployment concerns. It does not measure detailed knowledge of how each component works internally, but rather whether the candidate is familiar with various components and how to use them in the abstract.

# Claims - Performance Indicators
==============================

-   Claim/PI 1: The candidate is unfamiliar with basic system design concepts. They do not display understanding of simple web application components, and is likely unable to design a web API on their own.

-   Claim/PI 2: The candidate is comfortable with most basic system design concepts and shows some understanding of deployment strategies. They display passing familiarity with how to work with databases and web APIs. However, they are unable to identify performance or scaling issues, nor offer solutions to those issues. They may need help to avoid architectural missteps when designing a web system.

-   Claim/PI 3: The candidate understands how to build a web application, and they are able to identify common performance issues. They are comfortable with basic solutions like caching and distributed databases, but may not be familiar with more complex architecture elements like load balancers or CDNs.

-   Claim/PI 4: The candidate understands how to build and scale a web application, and they are comfortable identifying common performance and scaling issues. They are knowledgeable about the trade-offs of various database schemas and caching solutions. They may be less familiar with the non-technical trade-offs of different technologies and may miss a few details. However, their overall ability to design and implement a system is solid.

-   Claim/PI 5: The candidate is well-versed in system infrastructure and is quite capable of building and scaling complex web applications. They are knowledgeable about the trade-offs of various database schemas and caching solutions, as well as more complex architectural elements like load balancers and CDNs. They are comfortable with the operational aspects of large-scale distributed systems and may incorporate non-technical considerations, like cost, into their solutions.
