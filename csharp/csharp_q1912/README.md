## Stem
You have a string of 101 digits.
```
62831853071795864769252867665590057683943387987502116419498891846156328125724179972560696506842341359
```
Of all the digits from '5' to '9', '7' appears the least number of times.  '7' appears only 10 times.

Which Linq query below finds 7 using the above logic?



## Code Snippet (optional)



## Answer Key
```csharp
var result =
    from c in digits
    select Int32.Parse(c.ToString()) into d
    where d >= 5
    group d by d into g
    orderby g.Count()
    select g;
var least = result.First()?.Key;
```


## Distractors
### 1.
```csharp
var result =
    from c in digits
    where c >= 5
    group c by c into g
    orderby g.Count()
    select g;
var least = result.First()?.Key;
```


### 2.
```csharp
var result =
    from c in digits
    select Int32.Parse(c.ToString()) into d
    group d by d into g
    where g.Count() >= 5
    orderby g.Key
    select g;
var top = result.First();
```


### 3.
```csharp
var result =
    from c in digits
    group c by c into g
    select Int32.Parse(g.Key.ToString()) into d
    where d >= 5
    orderby d
    select d;
var least = result.First();
