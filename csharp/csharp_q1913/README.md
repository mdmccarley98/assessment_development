# C# ðŸŽµ 6 Coding: zero member


## Item ID
1913

## Claim
-   Claim 6 (Coding): Complete basic to intermediate coding tasks in C#. Low end here should be fizzbuzz-level, high end should be complex or tricky but not require any highly esoteric knowledge.


## Claim Behavior (evidence)

> But if you ignore this type of warning, sooner or later, something like this may very well find its way into your code:

      class Account {
      
          int myId;
          int Id;   // compiler warned you about this, but you didnâ€™t listen!
  
          // Constructor
          Account(int id) {
              this.myId = Id;     // OOPS!
          }
  
      }

> And at the speed Intellisense allows us to write code, this error isnâ€™t as improbable as it looks.
> 
> You now have a serious error in your program (although the compiler has only flagged it as a warning, for the reasons already explained), and depending on how complex your program is, you could waste a lot of time tracking this one down. Had you paid attention to this warning in the first place, you would have avoided this problem with a simple five-second fix.

Using this buggy `Example` class...

```csharp
public class Example
{
    public int Counter;
    public int Count => Counter;
    public Example(int count)
    {
        Counter = Count + 1;
    }
}
```

What is the value of `result`?

```csharp
int result = 0;
Example example;
for (var i = 3; i < 5; i++)
{
    example = new Example(i);
    result += example.Counter;
}
```

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
The constructor param `count` is lowercase, but the member value `Count` has an upper case.  So the `Counter` is always 0 + 1.
