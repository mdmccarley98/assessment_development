## Stem
Which of the following statement about `“frame”` and `“bounds”` of an `UIView` is correct?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
`“frame”` is the size and location of the view in its parent's coordinate system. `“bounds”` is the same information in its own coordinate system.

## Distractors

### 1.
They both represent the region occupied by the view. `“frame”` is an alias of `“bounds”`.

### 2.
`“frame”` is the size and location of the view's parent, and `“bounds”` is that of the view itself.

### 3.
`“frame”` is the size of the view itself, and `“bounds”` is the size of the view plus its margins.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
