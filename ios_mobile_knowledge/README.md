# iOS Mobile Knowledge - Claims with Content and Item Specifications (WIP)
==============================

The iOS Mobile Knowledge quiz assesses a candidate's understanding of the iOS ecosystem, including core iOS APIs and platform-specific tools. Topics on this quiz contain questions that assess both theoretical and practical knowledge of iOS tools, architecture, performance, and troubleshooting.

## Claims

- Claim 1:
- Claim 2:
- Claim 3:

## Score Level Definitions

- Level 1: The candidate is unfamiliar with native iOS development and the related languages and tools. They are unaware of common UI development tools, iOS interface components, or iOS performance optimizations, or are missing essential knowledge of Objective-C or Swift.

- Level 2: The candidate understands some of the basics of native iOS development and Objective-C or Swift. They show some familiarity with UI development tools, common iOS interface components like UITableView, and simple performance optimization strategies. However, they display little or no knowledge of troubleshooting techniques, iOS data persistence methods, or the internals of iOS as an operating system.

- Level 3: The candidate is comfortable with native iOS development and Objective-C or Swift. They understand how to use common UI development tools and display a solid foundation in performance profiling and troubleshooting. They show markers of real-world app design experience, but lack the advanced knowledge necessary to fix very subtle bugs or squeeze out maximum performance. They are likely able to build simple iOS apps on their own, but may make a few design errors.

- Level 4: The candidate is well-versed in native iOS development, along with both the underlying theory and practical application of Objective-C/Swift and of the iOS platform itself. They understand iOS data persistence methods, memory management, and performance profiling and troubleshooting, and they are comfortable using a range of UI development tools to create a responsive UI. They may not know all the details of advanced performance optimizations, but can clearly articulate tradeoffs between different libraries and tools. They display the ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical solutions that are close to optimal.

- Level 5: The candidate displays strong theoretical knowledge of and practical expertise in iOS native development from the simple to the complex. They demonstrate a deep understanding of a wide range of UI development tools, iOS data persistence methods, and memory management techniques. They can create highly-performance, responsive iOS apps and handle advanced profiling and troubleshooting.
