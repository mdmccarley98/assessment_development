# iOS: Leading Anchor


## Item ID
1814

## Claim
-   Claim/PI 2: The candidate understands some of the basics of native iOS development and Objective-C or Swift. They show some familiarity with UI development tools, common iOS interface components like UITableView, and simple performance optimization strategies. However, they display little or no knowledge of troubleshooting techniques, iOS data persistence methods, or the internals of iOS as an operating system.


## Claim Behavior (evidence)

> Left and Right constraints are absolute, they will always refer to the left/right of the screen or the control. Leading and trailing constraints are affected by the device locale; In locales where the reading direction is left to right (English, French, Spanish and so on) leading & left (and trailing & right) can be used interchangeably. In locales where the reading direction is right to left (e.g Hebrew, Arabic) then 'leading' will be the right side and 'trailing' will be the left side.
