# iOS: Master Detail


## Item ID
1815

## Claim
-   Claim/PI 2: The candidate understands some of the basics of native iOS development and Objective-C or Swift. They show some familiarity with UI development tools, common iOS interface components like UITableView, and simple performance optimization strategies. However, they display little or no knowledge of troubleshooting techniques, iOS data persistence methods, or the internals of iOS as an operating system.


## Claim Behavior (evidence)

> A navigation controller is a container view controller that manages one or more child view controllers in a navigation interface. In this type of interface, only one child view controller is visible at a time. Selecting an item in the view controller pushes a new view controller onscreen using an animation, thereby hiding the previous view controller. Tapping the back button in the navigation bar at the top of the interface removes the top view controller, thereby revealing the view controller underneath.
