What is the “layer” property on a UIView object?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
It is the view's Core Animation layer, used for rendering.

## Distractors

### 1.
It is an integer that represents the `UIView`'s position on the `z-axis` (the order in which views are rendered when multiple views overlap).

### 2.
It is used by `CompositeView`, and determines which subview is currently active (rendered and responsible for events).

### 3.
It's the view's interaction layer,  for receiving touch events.
