# iOS: Unwind Segue


## Item ID
1821

## Claim
-   Claim/PI 2: The candidate understands some of the basics of native iOS development and Objective-C or Swift. They show some familiarity with UI development tools, common iOS interface components like UITableView, and simple performance optimization strategies. However, they display little or no knowledge of troubleshooting techniques, iOS data persistence methods, or the internals of iOS as an operating system.


## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> To handle the dismissal of a view controller, create an unwind segue. Unlike the segues that you use to present view controllers, an unwind segue promises the dismissal of the current view controller without promising a specific target for the resulting transition. Instead, UIKit determines the target of an unwind segue programmatically at runtime.
