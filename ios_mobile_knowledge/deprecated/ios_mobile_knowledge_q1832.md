# iOS: Command Buffer


## Item ID
1832

## Claim
-   Claim/PI 4: The candidate is well-versed in native iOS development, along with both the underlying theory and practical application of Objective-C/Swift and of the iOS platform itself. They understand iOS data persistence methods, memory management, and performance profiling and troubleshooting, and they are comfortable using a range of UI development tools to create a responsive UI. They may not know all the details of advanced performance optimizations, but can clearly articulate tradeoffs between different libraries and tools. They display the ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical solutions that are close to optimal.


## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> In most cases, you use the commandBuffer method, because it creates a command buffer that holds a strong reference to any objects that Metal needs to finish executing the commands encoded in the command buffer.
