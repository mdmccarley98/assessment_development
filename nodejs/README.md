# Node.js - Claims with Content and Item Specifications (WIP)
Node.js  is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. The purpose of this atom is **not** to test knowledge of JavaScript language features (which is covered by the JavaScript atom) but to test understanding of Node.js features.

## Claims
- Claim 1: Candidate can understand and apply knowledge related to the Node.js concurrency model and event loop
- Claim 2: Candidate can understand and apply knowledge related to the Node package manager and module system
- Claim 3: Candidate can understand and apply knowledge related to the Node.js core libraries and frameworks

## Definition of Scores
Candidates that receive the following scores demonstrate the associated understanding and abilities:
1. Is unfamiliar with Node.js and only demonstrates a superficial understanding of Node.js core, Node Package Manager, and internals.
2. Has a basic understanding of how Node.js works but not familiar with practical concepts required to write a Node.js program (like imports, modules, etc.).
3. Has a working knowledge of Node.js and how Node.js programs are structured, but may not understand how Node.js works under the hood and would struggle to work with some complex, real-world Node.js projects.
4. Has strong knowledge of Node.js, core libraries, and Node Package Manager. However, they might need a little support in understanding the internals of a Node.js program. Users at this level should pick up the advanced concepts pretty fast.
5. Has an advanced understanding of Node.js internals, Node Package Manager, core libraries & frameworks, the event loop, and Node.js's concurrency model. The candidate will perform exceptionally well on real-world projects.

## Cognitive Model:
- Recall: can recall/recognize knowledge (e.g., definitions); can recall a memorized procedure to perform a task
- Comprehend: can comprehend/understand knowledge (e.g., how? why?); comprehend procedures to perform a task
- Use: can use or apply knowledge in complex task; perform a task

## Content Targets:
- Asynchronous Patterns
- Call Stack
- Event Loop
- I/O
- Node Package Manager
- Node Modules
- package.json scripts, npx, and prod/dev dependencies
- Core libraries
- Frameworks
