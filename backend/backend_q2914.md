Multiple Choice

## Stem
Which statement is true for a client-server architecture communicating over the HTTP protocol?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
HTTP does not have to run on port 80

## Distractors

### 1.
If there is a failure on the network, the client will receive a partial or malformed response from the server

### 2.
HTTP traffic between a client and a server is encrypted by default

### 3.
If a server response doesn't contain a status code, the associated request is considered successful

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- HTTP can run on any port but the standard port is 80
- HTTP uses TCP/IP as a transport layer ensuring the whole message is received by the receiver
- HTTPS is an extension of HTTP to secure data transferred
- HTTP must return the status code in the header
