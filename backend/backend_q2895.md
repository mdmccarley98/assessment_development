## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
What is a practical reason for running containers inside a system virtual machine?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
To increase security by reducing the scope of possible attack vectors

## Distractors
### 1.
To control the underlying hardware directly, without relying on the host operating system

### 2.
To improve isolation and mitigate the noisy neighbor effect

### 3.
To increase flexibility and make the system easier to deploy and maintain at scale

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Running containers inside VMs:
- comes with a trade-off between security and flexibility; containers are no longer exposed to OS-level vulnerabilities, but it becomes more difficult to deploy and maintain them at scale.
- does introduce a new level of isolation (technically), but not the kind of isolation that mitigates the noisy neighbor effect; this effect can only be mitigated with bare metal servers.
- does not allow direct control over the hardware; this is what a bare metal hypervisor does in the context of virtualization.
