Multiple Choice

## Stem
Is it generally safe to make a POST request that contains a user's password in plaintext, and why?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Yes - if the connection is over HTTPS, the information is secure in transit.

## Distractors

### 1.
Yes - the body of a POST request is encrypted, so the password is not exposed.

### 2.
No - even if the connection is over HTTPS, sensitive user data is still vulnerable to being sniffed by third parties.

### 3.
No - browsers cache POST requests, so if the user's browser is compromised their password can be recovered.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
NA
