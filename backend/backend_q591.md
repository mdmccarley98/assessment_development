Multiple Choice

## Stem
Say you work for a startup that has hit hockey stick growth. You need to horizontally scale the database to support the increased usage. What are the trade-offs between replicating vs sharding your database?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Sharding enables increased storage capacity and higher write load; replication improves system availability and increased read load performance.

## Distractors

### 1.
Replication is easy, but does not bring all the benefits of complete sharding. If you can fully shard, you should.

### 2.
Sharding makes partition tolerance harder (because required data might be on a shard on the wrong side of a network partition), but supports better availability guarantees.

### 3.
Replication maintains better consistency guarantees at the cost of partition tolerance.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
NA
