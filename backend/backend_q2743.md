Multiple Choice

## Stem
Event-driven architecture is NOT suitable for which of the following use-cases?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Compute-intensive systems

## Distractors
### 1.
IoT applications

### 2.
Push-based messaging systems

### 3.
GUI applications

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Compute-intensive systems perform computationally intensive work, often by running lengthy synchronous operations. While asynchronous programming models can aid with things like submission and start of work, these applications' core is executing CPU-bound tasks where event-driven architecture is irrelevant.
- Event-driven architecture is used in various IoT applications to process massive amounts of data generated by smart devices, sensors, etc., on the fly.
- Push-based messaging systems, where clients receive updates without needing to poll remote services, are commonly implemented with event-driven architectures.
- As they react to user events that trigger actions and provide instantaneous feedback, GUIs are event-driven by their very nature. Hence, these applications are almost always built on some event-driven platform or programming model.

Lacking the relevant experience or failing to make the aforementioned connections may yield an incorrect answer.
