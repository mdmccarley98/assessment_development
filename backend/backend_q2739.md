## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Which of the following software architectures is best suited for backend systems processing large amounts of data with asynchronous, non-blocking operations?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Event-driven architecture

## Distractors
### 1.
Microservice architecture

### 2.
Domain-driven architecture

### 3.
N-Tier architecture

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Microservice architecture is commonly associated with modularity, scalability and performance, which can mislead inexperienced engineers into thinking it could be the right choice for processing large amounts of data asynchronously.
- Domain-driven architecture, which stems from domain-driven design, prescribes ways of modeling and writing software to closely match the business domain it represents. Whether this approach is used or not is mostly irrelevant to the way data is funneled through and processed by the system.
- N-Tier architecture is about separating concerns and organizing software components into multiple tiers or layers, which is mostly unrelated to the question at hand.
