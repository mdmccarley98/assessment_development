How do long-polling and WebSocket compare?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Both allow two-way communication between clients and servers. Long-polling is a quick and dirty solution built on top of HTTP, while WebSocket provides an independent TCP-based protocol to achieve true bi-directional communication.

## Distractors

### 1.
Long-polling is simpler and more straightforward. However, the caching behavior of many networks (corporate firewalls in particular) necessitates WebSocket.

### 2.
Long-polling only allows transmission of short JSON or XML objects (it arose as an extension of AJAX). WebSocket extends it to allow longer messages and different content types.

### 3.
WebSocket is more secure. The protocol is more obscure, and packet sniffers are less likely to intercept and record your data.
