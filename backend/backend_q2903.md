Multiple Choice

## Stem
Which of the following is the de-facto web standard for authorizing users and providing secure flow of information between 2 trusting parties, like in client-server applications?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
JWT

## Distractors
### 1.
SSL

### 2.
TLS

### 3.
2FA

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- SSL (Secure Socket Layers) is a cryptographic protocol used to provide a secure connection and encrypt data between machines, servers, and applications over a network.
- TLS (Transport Layer Security), a successor of SSL, is just another cryptographic protocol used to provide data encryption over a network.
- 2FA (2-factor authentication) is a form of multi-factor authentication used for identity verification via time-based tokens, often implemented as a second layer of protection in client-server applications.

None of the above are responsible for user authorization but are often used for high-level authentication and in conjunction with JWT, which serves the purpose of authorizing users and controlling resource/data access in client-server applications.
