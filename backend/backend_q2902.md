## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Why are RESTful APIs considered stateless?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Because they don't track application state; each API request is self-contained and handled in isolation

## Distractors
### 1.
Because they don't change the state of the application; they only expose it to other applications

### 2.
Because they are designed for stateless applications

### 3.
REST architecture prescribes stateless design, but RESTful APIs are actually stateful

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- RESTful APIs can change the state of an application, but they don't store, track, or preserve it. 
- Both stateful and stateless applications make use of RESTful APIs; they were not designed for a specific type of application.
- RESTful APIs follow REST architecture principles and are stateless in principle.
