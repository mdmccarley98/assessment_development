Multiple Choice

## Stem
What is the purpose of **unit testing**?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
To test small, individual units of code (such as methods, classes, or modules) and verify their correctness

## Distractors
### 1.
To test independently developed units of code and verify that they work correctly when interacting with each other

### 2.
To test different application workflows from start to finish and simulate real use-case scenarios

### 3.
To test a software application as a complete unit and ensure it complies with expected functional requirements

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Unit testing is concerned with the smallest building blocks of a system or an application, aka units, and verifying their correctness. 
The process of testing these units for correct interoperability and interaction is called integration testing.
Testing entire workflows comprised of different interactions between these units is known as end-to-end testing.
High-level testing against specified functional requirements is referred to as functional testing.
