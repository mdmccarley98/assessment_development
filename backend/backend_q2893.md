## Stem
Which of the following is synonymous with **late binding**?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Dynamic dispatch

## Distractors
### 1.
Dependency injection

### 2.
Static binding

### 3.
Method overloading

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Static binding and method overloading are synonymous with early binding or compile-time polymorphism, while late binding, dynamic dispatch, and method overriding refer to runtime polymorphism. While dependency injection can sometimes rely on late binding, it doesn't have to, and one doesn't imply the other.
