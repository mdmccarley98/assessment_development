Multiple Choice

## Stem
Which of the following approaches mitigates the fragile pointcut problem in aspect-oriented systems?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Implementing annotation-based pointcuts with dynamic conditions and behaviors

## Distractors
### 1.
Relying on load-time aspect weaving

### 2.
Relying on source-level aspect weaving

### 3.
Implementing hard-coded pointcuts with static conditions and behaviors

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
The aspect weaving process is less relevant and the key is to use reflection with dynamically evaluated conditions and additional behaviors triggered by a smart pointcut declaration and configuration system.
