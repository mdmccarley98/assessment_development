Multiple Choice

## Stem
Which of the following statements is **incorrect** when it comes to GraphQL?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
GraphQL supports native HTTP caching

## Distractors
### 1.
GraphQL makes it extremely easy to prevent over-fetching data

### 2.
GraphQL relies on a strongly typed schema for exchanging data

### 3.
GraphQL eliminates the need for explicit API versioning

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- One of the main quirks of GraphQL is that it is not cacheable at the HTTP level by default.
- Declarative data fetching makes worrying about over-fetching and under-fetching a non-issue.
- Utilizing a strongly typed DSL, GraphQL comes with a built-in error detection and prevention mechanism.
- By design, GraphQL encourages building version-less APIs by continuously evolving the schema.
