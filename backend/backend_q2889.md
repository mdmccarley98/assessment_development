Multiple Choice

## Stem
What is the purpose of **functional testing**?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
To test an application from a high-level perspective and ensure it complies with expected functional requirements

## Distractors
### 1.
To test small, individual units of code (such as methods, classes, or modules) and verify their functional correctness

### 2.
To test different application workflows from start to finish and simulate real use-case scenarios

### 3.
To test independently developed units of code and verify that they function correctly when interacting with each other

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Unit testing is concerned with the smallest building blocks of a system or an application, aka units, and verifying their correctness. 
The process of testing these units for correct interoperability and interaction is called integration testing.
Testing entire workflows comprised of different interactions between these units is known as end-to-end testing.
High-level testing against specified functional requirements is referred to as functional testing.
