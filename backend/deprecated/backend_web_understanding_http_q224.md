How is the hostname (example.com) used during an HTTP request?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
It is used by your browser to decide what IP address to send the request to, and is also sent as a header so the server can choose what content to display.

## Distractors

### 1.
It is used in the DNS lookup that your browser does, but it is totally ignored by the server which responds to your request.

### 2.
It is only used by the server which receives your request to decide what content to serve. Your browser treats it like the rest of the URL.

### 3.
Itâ€™s used in the routing protocol (BGP) that routers use to get TCP packets from your computer to the specified host.
