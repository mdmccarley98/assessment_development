How is a reverse proxy different from a forward proxy?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Reverse proxies relay external requests to servers on an internal network. Forward proxies relay requests from internal clients to external servers.

## Distractors

### 1.
Forward proxies can handle and cache HTTP requests, whereas reverse proxies also handle Websockets, SSL, and sticky session.

### 2.
Reverse proxies are designed to protect against XSS and CSRF attacks, whereas forward proxies are primarily used for load balancing across app servers.

### 3.
Forward proxies are used for SSL termination and sticky sessions. Reverse proxies are most commonly used for caching images and HTML pages.
