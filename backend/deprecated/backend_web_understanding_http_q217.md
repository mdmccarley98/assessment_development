## Stem
When you load a page for a modern web app with a modern browser, which of the following is closest to true?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
You make multiple HTTP requests, but HTTP keep-alive means that you can often do these in less than one TCP connection per resource loaded.

## Distractors

### 1.
You only make a single HTTP request.

### 2.
You make an HTTP request for each type of resource: all your Javascript is bundled into a single file, all your images are bundled into a single file, and so on.

### 3.
You make multiple HTTP requests, and these are generally made by a parallel TCP connection from your client for each resource you're trying to load.
