## Stem
What's the relationship between HTTP and HTTPS?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
HTTPS is HTTP tunneled over the encrypted protocols SSL or TLS.

## Distractors

### 1.
HTTPS is an extension of the HTTP protocol that encrypts request and response bodies.

### 2.
HTTP is text-based and thus insecure. HTTPS is binary and secure against man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 3.
HTTPS adds support for request pipelining to HTTP. Normally, SSL is added to the pipeline to encrypt the protocol.
