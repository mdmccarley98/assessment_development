When is it safe to trust external parameters received by your web-server?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
It's never safe.

## Distractors

### 1.
If you whitelist IPs and the request is from a whitelisted IP, it's safe.

### 2.
If those parameters are escaped properly by the client, it's safe.

### 3.
HTTP params aren't safe because they are set by the user. However, HTTP headers are not. Those are the only external parameters that you can consider safe.
