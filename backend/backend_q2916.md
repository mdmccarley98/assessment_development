Multiple Choice

## Stem
What is NOT a valid statement regarding the ELK Stack?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
K stands for Kibana, which is a visualization tool for displaying XML data returned by Elasticsearch

## Distractors

### 1.
The ELK Stack is used for collecting, aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing log data

### 2.
L stands for Logstash, which collects logs, formats them, and outputs them to the Elasticsearch cluster

### 3.
E stands for Elasticsearch, which stores logs and supports full-text search from a RESTful API

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Elasticsearch by default outputs JSON format. It can be configured to return other formats like CSV but not XML
