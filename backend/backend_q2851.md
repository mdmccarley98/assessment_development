Multiple Choice

## Stem
What is NOT an advantage of continuous integration (CI)?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
CI replaces manual QA and greatly improves test suite coverage.

## Distractors
### 1.
A continuous deployment process can easily be integrated into the CI pipeline to release application builds on a regular cadence.

### 2.
CI ensures that tests get run against every code change which saves time and minimizes regressions in the long run.

### 3.
CI can detect any test failure before new code changes are merged into the master branch.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- CI does not substitute manual QA testing of critical paths.
- On the one hand, CI runs tests automatically, so developers does not need to when they are introducing a new change to the application. On the other hand, server needs to run tests for every pull request, which takes more server resources.
