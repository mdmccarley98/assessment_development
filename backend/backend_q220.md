What's a sticky session?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
A sticky session is a load balancing technique where each client is consistently mapped to a specific server. This allows the servers to store state locally.

## Distractors

### 1.
A sticky session is a user session where session data is stored directly in a cookie (rather than storing just an ID). This allows faster processing on the server side.

### 2.
A sticky session is a long running HTTP connection. The client can hold this connection open, and thus reduce the time it takes to make a request.

### 3.
A sticky session is a particularly expensive HTTP request. Identifying sticky sessions is key to optimizing a web backend.
