# Back-end - Summary of Claims
A candidate who *passes* the back-end assessment and receives the back-end concepts badge has demonstrated evidence for all three (3) claims defined below.

## Claims
- **Claim 1 (`architecture_design`):** The candidate understands common software architecture patterns like client-server, microservice, and event-driven architectures. They are familiar with different software design and development methodologies like domain-driven design and test-driven development, as well as server-side programming fundamentals, including object-oriented and functional style programming, design patterns, automated testing, etc.
- **Claim 2 (`data_apis`):** The candidate is familiar with common data storage, retrieval, and manipulation techniques, including SQL and noSQL databases, CRUD operations, data caching, indexing, versioning, etc. They understand how data flows between systems and across a network, how RESTful and non-RESTful APIs are designed, implemented, and consumed.
- **Claim 3 (`infrastructure`):** The candidate knows how application servers work, how to deploy, host, and manage a service or an application on the web. They are familiar with common security, logging, and monitoring mechanisms, as well as version control and CI/CD fundamentals.

## Score-Level definitions
Candidates with the following scores demonstrate the associated understanding and abilities:

- **Level 1:** The candidate knows the basics of some fundamental concepts, e.g., what a RESTful API is, but they can't answer specific questions regarding HTTP requests, responses, or authentication methods. They know very little about software design and architecture but may be capable of contributing on systems already deployed into production, by working on very small and well-defined tasks.
- **Level 2:** The candidate has a high-level understanding of backend engineering fundamentals, may know some key concepts and their application but lacks a complete understanding of all of their implementation details. They can write functional code and implement certain functional requirements but will sometimes struggle defending their design choices or assessing and implementing non-functional requirements.
- **Level 3:** The candidate has solid practical knowledge of backend systems and is able to make deliberate design choices to achieve specific goals and fulfill both functional and non-functional requirements. They can probably build a working system from scratch but lack the know-how and experience to optimize their solutions or deal with complex issues. They are likely to overlook or poorly implement certain things like logging or data caching, delivering incomplete or suboptimal solutions as a result.
- **Level 4:** The candidate knows many relevant concepts in-depth and is capable of producing high-quality work autonomously. They have sufficient knowledge and skill to build, modify, and optimize large-scale backend systems but may have small gaps in specific areas and be less efficient when tackling complex architectural challenges.
- **Level 5:** The candidate has in-depth conceptual and practical knowledge across all assessed areas. They know the ins and outs of advanced topics like database replication and sharding strategies and are able to anticipate and act on issues before they turn into problems. They are likely to pay attention to commonly overlooked or seemingly nonessential things, arriving at very robust and optimal solutions by default.

## Cognitive Model
- Recall: can recall/recognize knowledge (e.g., definitions); can recall a memorized procedure to perform a task
- Comprehend: can comprehend/understand knowledge (e.g., how? why?); comprehend procedures to perform a task
- Use: can use or apply knowledge in a complex task; perform a task
