## Stem
What is a valid statement about distributed systems?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Contrary to parallel systems, distributed systems lack shared memory.

## Distractors

### 1.
When nodes in a distributed system are connected with the star topology, the system is fault-tolerant.

### 2.
Nodes in a distributed system communicate with each other by sending messages, and each message contains a timestamp from the global clock all nodes have access to.

### 3.
Nodes in a distributed system always run the same version of the same operating system.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Nodes run their own operating system and can run different versions of the same or a different operating system.
- Main limitations of the distributed system are the absence of a global clock and shared memory.   
- One of the main struggles in building distributed systems is making them fault-tolerant. Node topology by itself does not solve this problem and additional mechanism, such as failover systems and consensus algorithms, are required.
