Multiple Choice

## Stem
The WebSocket protocol builds and extends existing technologies and protocols. From the server's perspective, what is a WebSocket connection?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
A TCP connection which can be on any port and that follows a specific protocol

## Distractors
### 1.
A connection on the WebSocket port 9511

### 2.
A UDP connection that is designed to allow for fast bidirectional messaging

### 3.
A special extension to HTTP that allows for communication on non-standard ports

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
It's not unusual for those first encountering WebSockets to be confused by the name into thinking they are somehow discrete from a standard TCP connection and can be surprised to learn that the "magic" lies in the protocol, not the port or the kind of connection made on that port.
