## Stem
Suppose you're building a web application and would like to store a piece of data in a cookie. If you don't want users to be able to read or tamper with this data, which of the following approaches should you take?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Use AES to encrypt the data, then use HMAC to authenticate it. Store the encrypted data and the HMAC in the cookie.

## Distractors

### 1.
Use SHA-256 to hash the data, and store the hash in the cookie.

### 2.
Use PGP to generate a public/private key pair for the web app. Encrypt the data with the private key and store the encrypted data along with the public key in the cookie.

### 3.
Use OAuth2 to generate a public/private key pair unique to the user. Encrypt the data with the public key and store the encrypted data in the cookie.
