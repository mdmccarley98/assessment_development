> ## Items
> 
> The main goal in scraping is to extract structured data from unstructured sources, typically, web pages. Spiders may return the extracted data as *items*, Python objects that define key-value pairs.
> 
> Scrapy supports multiple types of items. When you create an item, you may use whichever type of item you want. When you write code that receives an item, your code should work for any item type.

## Stem

You want to check if a GPU is in stock at a store.  So you use the `scrapy` library.

What is an `Item` in the `scrapy` library?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
An `Item` is structured data extracted from a page.

## Distractors

### 1.
An `Item` is a product listing.

### 2.
An `Item` is an XSL path to a place in a page.

### 3.
An `Item` is an entity that has already been crawled.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
An item could be a product listing, or data that has been crawled.  It could be an email address, an article, a song, or any thing.  But it's most accurately structured data (organized or parsed) from an unstructured (HTML) page.
