## Stem

For arbitrary Python objects `x`, `y`, `z`, which of the following is necessarily true?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
`x <= y` implies `[x] <= [y]`

## Distractors

### 1.

`x < y < z` implies `x < z`

### 2.
`x == y` implies `not (x != y)`

### 3.
`(x < y) or (x == y)` implies `x <= y`

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

The correct answer describes the behavior of the list built-in type.

All the distractors describe the behavior of arbitrary objects, for which the methods can be overloaded to define any behavior.
