You have a dictionary with some months and numbers in it.

```python
months = dict(January=1, February=2, March=3)
```

Which of the following will print the month name and number as follows:

```
January 1
February 2
March 3
```


## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key

```python
for k, v in months.items():
    print(k, v)
```


## Distractors

### 1.
```python
for k, v in months:
    print(k, v)
```

### 2.
```python
for i in months.values():
    print(i, months[i])
```

### 3.
```python
for i in range(months):
    print(i, months[i])
```


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

It's good to remember the .items() function for other python related things like django templates:
```
{% for key, value in dict.items %}
```
