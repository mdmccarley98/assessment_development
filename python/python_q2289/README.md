## Stem

By default, when you import a `.py` file, CPython compiles that source code into a file with the `.pyc` extension.

Which of the following is true about these `pyc` files?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```python


```

## Answer Key

If `module.py` does not exist, then `import module` will load `module.pyc` instead

## Distractors

### 1.

`pyc` files contain machine code specialized for the active CPU architecture


### 2.

Importing a `pyc` generated by a newer version of Python using an older interpreter can cause a crash


### 3.

If Python does not have permission to write the `pyc` to the file system, importing fails with ImportError


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

Note the PYC will only be imported from the main directory (not __pycache__ folder) and only if the PY does not exist. This is to support source-less distribution of code.

D1 - these files contain portable bytecode, not machine code
D2 - if the version number in the `pyc` doesn't match, the `pyc` is just regenerated
D3 - if writing the `pyc` fails, the module is still imported successfully (just not cached)
