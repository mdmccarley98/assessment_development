How do you use sphinx's autodoc extension to document the `message` field as a `str` type for the function below?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
```python
def send(message):
    """
    :param str message: Sends this message to the console.
    """
    print(message)
```


## Distractors
### 1.
```python
@param('message', 'Sends this message to the console.', 'str')
def send(message):
    print(message)
```

### 2.
```python
# @message str: Sends this message to the console.
def send(message):
    print(message)
```

### 3.
```python
@doc(param='message', description='Sends this message to the console.', type='str')
def send(message):
    print(message)
```


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

By default, sphinx won't autodocument a function, you have to add the `'sphinx.ext.autodoc'` extension and the following to a file:
```rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

But after doing this, sphinx autodoc doesn't use comments above a function to document it, and instead relies on docstrings written with specific tags.
