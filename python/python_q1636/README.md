What's the difference between `shutil.copy` and `shutil.copy2`?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key

`copy2` tries to preserve metadata.

## Distractors

`copy2` copies a file from a source to a destination, but `copy` makes a duplicate with the same file name.

### 2.
`copy2` recursively copies an entire directory tree.

### 3.
`copy2` is not a function in `shutil`.
