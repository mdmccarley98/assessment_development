## Stem

In CPython, objects are normally freed automatically when they become unreachable. Prior to CPython 3.4, which of the following would be stored in `gc.garbage` instead of being freed?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Two objects that reference each other and define `__del__` methods

## Distractors

### 1.
A list that has itself as a member

### 2.
Three objects with cyclic references to each other

### 3.
A dictionary that has itself as a value


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

Prior to PEP 442 (May 2013, CPython 3.4) the objects in the answer would be uncollectible.
