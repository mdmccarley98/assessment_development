## Stem

The standard library `enum` provides classes to create enumerations, a set of members (names) bound to constant values. 

Which of these classes provides enumerations where a member with value zero coerces to boolean False, and two members with the same value are unequal if they come from different enumerations?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key

enum.Flag

## Distractors

### 1.

enum.Enum

### 2.

enum.IntEnum

### 3.

enum.IntFlag



## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

Enum does not meet condition (a) and IntEnum and IntFlag both fail condition (b).
