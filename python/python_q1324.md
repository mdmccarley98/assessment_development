## Content Review

- Accuracy: ðŸ”¸
    * so happy that `example.com` was used instead of `foo.com` ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
    * fixed typo: `pythonurl` != `url` by putting the url the function
    * distractor 1 and distractor 3 were identical
    * `get()` or `post()` are irrelevant to the stem, so changed the stem sample to use `get()`
    * added clarification to stem to imagine that example.com/sample.json will return valid json (which it won't in reality)
    * changed distractor 1 from `res.json()` to `res.body`
    * changed distractor 3 from `res.json()` to `res.body.json()` (JavaScript style)

- Alignment: âœ…

* fixed `<code>` formatting to ` ```python `
* tested with `requests==2.24.0`
