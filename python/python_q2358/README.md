## Stem

Python has built-in support for imaginary numbers, which are the square roots of negative numbers.

Which expression below evaluates to the square root of negative 4?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key

`2j`

## Distractors

### 1.

`complex(2)`

### 2.

`complex("2i")`


### 3.

`math.sqrt(-4)`


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

D1: first positional arg is real part, so this is just 2.
D2: `i` is not allowed in Python, `j` is used following the electrical engineering convention
D3: `math` module throws exceptions on complex numbers. Use `cmath` instead.
