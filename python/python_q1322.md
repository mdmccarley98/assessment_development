## Stem
In numpy, what is the difference between using `*`, `@`, `numpy.matmul()`, and `numpy.dot()` on two numpy arrays?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key

* `*` is element-wise multiplication
* `@` and `matmul()` are matrix multiplication
* `dot()` is the dot product

## Distractors 
### 1.
* `*`, `@`, `matmul()`, and `dot()` are all matrix multiplication

### 2.
* `*` is element-wise multiplication
* `@`, `matmul()`, and `dot()` are matrix multiplication

### 3.

* `*` is element-wise multiplication
* `matmul()` is matrix multiplication
* `@` and `dot()` are the dot product


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional)

## Content Review

- Accuracy: ðŸ‘Ž
    * fixed typo "mulitplication" -> "multiplication"
    * `dot()` is the dot product, which is not the same for a 3D matrix as `np.matmul()`

        "If a is an N-D array and b is an M-D array (where M>=2), it is a sum product over the last axis of a and the second-to-last axis of b"
