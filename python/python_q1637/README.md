Multiple Choice

## Stem

There is a Cup class defined in the current context as follows:
```python
# example.py
class Cup:
    coffee = False
```

Using the `dir` function, which python expressions return `True`?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key

```python
'coffee' in dir(Cup)
'Cup' in dir()
```

## Distractors

### 1.
```python
'coffee' in dir('Cup')
```

### 2.
```python
'example.py' in dir()
```

### 3.
```python
dir in builtins
```


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

The `dir` function is very useful when running the python interpreter from the command line, so you can see which values are declared in the current context, what is available in a module, or which members are in a class.
