## Code Snippet (optional)

In Python 3, which of the following is both an iterable and an iterator?

## Answer Key

`(i for i in range(100))`

## Distractors

### 1.

`range(100)`

### 2.

`set(range(100))`

### 3.

`list(range(100))`


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

An iterable implements the `__iter__` method which returns an iterator. The iterator may or may not be the same object as the iterable, and has a `__next__` method.
