## Stem

When using multiple inheritance in Python, the Method Resolution Order (MRO) determines in what order types are searched for methods.

Which of the following properties of the MRO is NOT guaranteed by the Python language?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key

The MRO can be uniquely determined for any inheritance hierarchy

## Distractors

### 1.

Each type appears in the MRO exactly once

### 2.

Creating a new subclass never affects the MRO of its parent classes

### 3.

The search order for attributes also obeys the MRO

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

It is an error at class definition time if the class's MRO cannot be defined in a consistent and unambiguous way.
