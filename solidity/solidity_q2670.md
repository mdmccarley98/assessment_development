## Stem
MakerDAO is a decentralized organization built on Ethereum to permit the lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies without the need for an intermediary. Which of the following statements does NOT apply to MakerDAO?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
MakerDAO is made up of a smart contract service that manages borrowing and lending without the need for stablecoins.

## Distractors
### 1.
MakerDAO created the Maker (MKR) token, and its primary intent is to support the stability of MakerDAO's DAI token and enable governance for the Dai Credit System.

### 2.
Vat - The single source of truth for the Maker Protocol. It contains the accounting system of the core Vault, Internal Dai balances, and collateral state. The Vat has no external dependencies and maintains the central "Accounting Invariants" of the Maker Protocol.

### 3.
The value of collateral in a Vault is derived from its global, free-market USD price. An oracle module is deployed for each collateral type.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common errors: Actually you need at least one stablecoin to regulate the value of loans.

MakerDAO is made up of a smart contract service that manages borrowing and lending, as well as two currencies: DAI and MKR to regulate the value of loans.

In the MakerDAO case it is the DAI stablecoin.
