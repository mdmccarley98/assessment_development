## Stem
Which of the following definitions of abstract contracts in Solidity is WRONG?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
If a contract inherits from an abstract contract and does not implement all non-implemented functions by overriding, it does not need to be marked as abstract as well.

## Distractors
### 1.
A contract needs to be marked as abstract when at least one of its functions is not implemented.

### 2.
A contract may be marked as abstract even though all functions are implemented.

### 3.
An abstract contract has to be clearly marked as such `abstract contract Name`.
