## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
You have coded a DeFi smart contract that holds a considerable amount of Total Value Locked (TVL) for a client. The client argues that his private keys are not secure since everybody can guess them and thus withdraw the balance.
<br><br>
You are tasked to convince him the opposite.
<br><br>
Which argument below is NOT the appropriate way to start the discussion?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Ethereum's address private keys are three times more complicated to compute than Bitcoin's, making them mathematically impractical to guess even with Quantum computers.

## Distractors
### 1.
It is impractical to brute force private keys with today's available computing power.

### 2.
Avoiding simple private keys like those as simple as '1' is a good approach.

### 3.
Avoid making part of the number 'k', often called the nonce, public. Therefore make sure to use a wallet that correctly generates 'k'.
