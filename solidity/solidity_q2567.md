## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
ERC20 allows for implementing a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens and enables them to be approved so another on-chain third party can spend them.

## Distractors
### 1.
ERC20 outlines a smart contract interface that can represent any number of fungible and non-fungible token types.

### 2.
ERC20 describes the details of the Ethereum Name Service, a proposed protocol and ABI definition that provides flexible resolution of short, human-readable names to service and resource identifiers. 

### 3.
ERC20 is used to simply and cheaply clone contract functionality in an immutable way. This standard specifies a minimal bytecode implementation that delegates all calls to a known, fixed address.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common errors:
1. ERC1155: Multi Token Standard outlines a smart contract interface that can represent any number of fungible and non-fungible token types.
2. EIP-137: Ethereum Domain Name Service describes the details of the Ethereum Name Service, a proposed protocol and ABI definition that provides flexible resolution of short, human-readable names to service and resource identifiers. 
3. EIP-1167: Minimal Proxy Contract is used to simply and cheaply clone contract functionality in an immutable way, this standard specifies a minimal bytecode implementation that delegates all calls to a known, fixed address.
