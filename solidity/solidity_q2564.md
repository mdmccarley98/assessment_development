Multiple Choice 

## Stem
The Deploy & Run module in Remix IDE allows you to send transactions to the current environment. Which of the following options is NOT part of the supported environments in Remix IDE? 

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
`EOS VM` is designed from the ground up for the high demands of blockchain applications which require far more from a WebAssembly engine than those designed for web browsers or standards development. 

## Distractors
### 1.
`JavaScript VM`: All the transactions will be executed in a sandbox blockchain in the browser. This means nothing will be persisted when you reload the page. The JsVM is its own blockchain, and on each reload, it will start a new blockchain; the old one will not be saved.

### 2.
`Injected Provider`: Remix will connect to an injected web3 provider. Metamask is an example of a provider that injects web3.

### 3.
`Web3 Provider`: Remix will connect to a remote node. You will need to provide the URL to the selected provider: geth, parity, or any Ethereum client.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

The EOS blockchain is not EVM compatible.
