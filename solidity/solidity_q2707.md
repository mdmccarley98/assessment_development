## Stem
You have been tasked to develop a strategy to continuously audit and monitor a specific set of DeFi smart contracts.
<br><br>
The monitoring approach should cover the following aspects:
- - You should be alerted when new contracts associated with this protocol are deployed.
- - You would like to monitor state continuously.
- - You want to monitor how the particular set of smart contracts may react to changes in environments such as, but not limited to, the addition of liquidity in the pool, initialization state of other contracts, approvals, or balances in tokens.
<br><br>
This is required since the monitored set of smart contracts is periodically updated, and new contracts are also added to the set.
