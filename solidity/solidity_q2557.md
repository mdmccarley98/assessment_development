## Stem
A mapping is declared as `mapping(_KeyType => _ValueType)`. Choose the option that does NOT apply to a declaration of a mapping?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Mappings are used in `memory`, where they are virtually initialized with every potential key and mapped to a value.

## Distractors
### 1.
Mappings can be thought of as virtually initialized hash tables. Every potential key exists and has a value associated with it.

### 2.
Except for mappings, dynamically sized arrays, contracts, enums, and structs, `key` can be nearly any type.

### 3.
The term `value` can refer to any type, including mappings.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
### Common Errors
A mapping is a dynamic type working as a storage (not memory) key-value database.
