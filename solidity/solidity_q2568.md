## Stem
Which of the options listed below is NOT part of the ERC1155 standard definition?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
ERC1155 is a standardized way to retrieve royalty payment information for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enable universal support for royalty payments across all NFT marketplaces and ecosystem participants.

## Distractors
### 1.
Smart contracts implementing the ERC-1155 standard must implement all of the functions in the ERC1155 interface.

### 2.
The ERC1155 Multi Token Standard is a standard interface for contracts that manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, or other configurations (e.g., semi-fungible tokens).

### 3.
The ERC1155 Multi Token Standard allows each token ID to represent a new configurable token type, which may have its own metadata, supply, and other attributes.
