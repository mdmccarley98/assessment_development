## Stem
You have been tasked to identify, classify, and list cyber threats in Decentralized Finance. Which of the following does NOT belong to that threat stack?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
The DeFi threat stack to the Proof-of-Work hashing power includes dumping malware on mining rigs. The attack techniques are phishing hash sending and engineering hash computing.

## Distractors
### 1.
The threat stack to DeFi protocols includes protocol and market attacks. The attack techniques are the price oracle attack, signature exploit, double-spend, and rebase exploit. The main aim of the threat stack to DeFi protocols is ultimately gaining access to crypto funds.

### 2.
The DeFi threat stack to smart contracts includes access control attacks, input/output attacks, and error handling attacks. The attack techniques are integer overflow and underflow, public method, reentrancy, and delegatecall untrusted contract.

### 3.
The DeFi threat stack to the Ethereum Virtual Machine includes economic and governance attacks. The attack techniques are homoglyph attack, Mempool manipulation, circulating supply dump, and the dusting attack.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common errors:
The DeFi threat stack to to the internet Ethereum architecture stack includes routing attacks and indeed also malicious software, but even if a hacker manages to dump malware on mining computers, due to the fact that Ethereum is highly decentrlized, the probability that this malware attack considerably influences the hashing power and thus the consensus is negligible. Besides there is also social engineering. The attack techniques are (spear) phishing, DNS spoofing, private keys and tampered HD wallets.
