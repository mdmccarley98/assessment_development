## Stem
Which of the following descriptions about gas is WRONG?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Gas credits in Ethereum can be transferred between the mainnet and the testnet.

## Distractors
### 1.
Upon creation, each transaction is charged with a certain amount of gas, whose purpose is to limit the amount of work needed to execute the transaction and pay for this execution at the same time. While the EVM executes the transaction, the gas is gradually depleted according to specific rules.

### 2.
The gas price is a value set by the transaction creator, who has to pay `gas_price * gas` upfront from the sending account. If some gas is left after the execution, it is refunded to the creator in the same way.

### 3.
If the gas is used up at any point (i.e., it would be negative), an out-of-gas exception is triggered, which reverts all modifications made to the state in the current call frame.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common errors:
Gas is paid in Ethereum. On the mainnet the gas consumption is charged with mainnet Ethereum and on testnets like Kovan with testnet Ethereum.
Only mainnet Ethereum has a market value exchangable to fiat or other cryptocurrencies.
