## Item Type
Multiple Choice 

## Stem
Which of the following definitions of the contract Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification is WRONG?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
The ABI supports all Solidity types.

## Distractors
### 1.
The contract ABI is the standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the blockchain and for contract-to-contract interaction.

### 2.
The contract ABI specification does not address contracts whose interface is dynamic or otherwise known only at run-time.

### 3.
The encoding in the contract ABI specification is not self-describing and thus requires a schema to decode.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
Common errors:
Some Solidity types are not supported by the ABI.
Examples:
In Solidity: address payable
In ABI: address
In Solidity: contract
In ABI: address
In Solidity: enum
In ABI: uint8
