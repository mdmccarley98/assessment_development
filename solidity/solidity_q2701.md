## Stem
A customer asked you to perform an analysis on his smart contract. Besides relying on manual analysis, you also decide to use a framework for smart contract analysis.

The scope of the analysis should include the following:
- 1. Inheritance-graph printing to emphasize inadvertent shadowing and C3 linearization issues.
- 2. Function summary to report function visibility and access controls.
- 3. Vars and auth printer to report access controls on state variables.

Which tool is the most appropriate for this approach?
