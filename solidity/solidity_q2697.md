## Item Type
Multiple Choice 

## Stem
You have been tasked to investigate an exploit of a DeFi protocol resulting in a substantial financial loss for your client. The attacker has used a smart contract to stage the attack but has not verified the source code on Etherscan. Nevertheless, your investigation needs to gain access to the smart contract code to reconstruct the attack and thus prevent similar incidents in the future. Which approach is most suitable to begin your investigation? 

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Decompile the Solidity bytecode.

## Distractors
### 1.
Search Github for a smart contract that may have been used or adapted to stage the attack.

### 2.
Search similar exploits and compare findings.

### 3.
Contact smart contract audit companies to assist in the investigation.
