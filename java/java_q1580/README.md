## Stem
The following answers are about the differences between Arrays and Lists. Which answer is *NOT* true?

## Code Snippet

## Answer Key
Arrays can only store primitive values. Lists can store either objects or primitive values.

## Distractors
### 1.
Arrays have a fixed size. Lists are dynamically sized.

### 2.
Obtaining the number of elements in an Array is done with the `length` property. Obtaining the number of elements in a List is done with the `size()` method.

### 3.
Arrays cannot be defined to store generic types. Lists can take full advantage of Generics.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):

* Arrays can store either objects or primitive values.
* Lists only store objects, though Java's autoboxing feature may give the impression that a List can store primitives.
* Arrays cannot be defined with Generic types.
