What does this class help you do?

## Code Snippet


## Answer Key
Write a `toString` method on an `Object`.

## Distractors

### 1.
Deserializes a string into an `Object`.

### 2.
Turn an `Object` into a JSON string.

### 3.
Check if two `Object`s are equal by their string.


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):
Writing a `toString` function can be tedious, and difficult to make consistent across all the Objects in your program.
`ToStringHelper` provides a fluent interface for creating a `toString` function.
