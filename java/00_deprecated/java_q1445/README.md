Multiple Choice

## Stem
You are working on an online video game.
There is a central MySQL database that stores information like 
which items a player owns, and how much money they have.
You need to write a server that accesses this database to talk to the game.

Which Java library will best help you access and modify data in the MySQL server?

## Code Snippet


## Answer Key
* Hibernate

## Distractors
### 1.
* Apache Lucene
### 2.
* RxJava
### 3.
* LWJGL

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):
* Hibernate is an ORM that helps you access SQL databases like MySQL.
* Lucene is a text indexing and searching library, not a tool to help you write SQL.
* RxJava helps you compose asynchronous data, but not interact with MySQL.
* LWJGL is a general collection of libraries for game development, possibly including ODBC, but LWJGL itself is not designed to access SQL data.
