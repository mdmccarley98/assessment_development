Multiple Choice

## Stem
Java applications are often packaged and delivered as *JAR* files. For the following command, how does Java know where to begin execution?


## Code Snippet (optional)
`java -jar Example.jar`

## Answer Key
JAR files must contain a Manifest.txt file that specifies the entry point, such as:
`Main-Class: org.example.MyClass`


## Distractors

### 1.
Java executes the `main()` method, and there can only be one `main()` method per JAR file.

### 2.
Java would not be able to execute this application, because the entry point must always be specified on the command line.

### 3.
Java starts the execution with the first class on the classpath.


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):

* JAR files can have any number of classes with `main()` methods.
* Typically, applications that are bundled as JAR files specify the entry point in the JAR Manifest.
* It is possible to start an application at an entry-point that is different than the one specified by the JAR Manifest.
* Java libraries distributed as JAR files typically do not specify an entry-point.
