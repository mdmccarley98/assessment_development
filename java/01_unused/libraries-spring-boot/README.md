Multiple Choice

## Stem
In Spring Boot applications, what are Actuator endpoints?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Actuator endpoints expose an interface to monitor and manage an application, either through HTTP or JMX.


## Distractors

### 1.
Actuator endpoints are a category of Aspect Oriented join points that allow you to insert behavior at the end of Web MVC controller executions.

### 2.
An actuator endpoint is the final phase in the internal state machine of a Spring Actor, which is used as a lightweight concurrency primitive.

### 3.
Actuator endpoints are a type of Rest Controller that generate implementations for standard CRUD operations without having to write custom code. These implementations are based on the application's JPA mappings.


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):

* Spring Boot is a very popular foundation for building Java applications.
* Spring Boot streamlines many aspects of making an application production-ready.
* Actuator endpoints allow for the monitoring and management of applications that are running in production environments.
