Multiple Choice

## Stem
You are writing an Android app that needs to access multiple APIs at the same time during startup.
It needs to access a settings API to figure out which features to turn on or off.
It needs to log the user in if they have a valid token.
The app needs to get data for the main page.
And it needs to use the login token to get the user's messages.
After all that the main page can be displayed.

Which library will help you asynchronously manage this data?

## Code Snippet


## Answer Key
* RxJava

## Distractors
### 1.
* Spring Boot
### 2.
* Apache Thrift
### 3.
* AWS DataSync

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):
* RxJava helps you compose asynchronous data.
* Spring Boot would help you write the HTTP server API, but you are writing an Android app.
* Apache Thrift will help you access data in other programming languages, not write async Java code.
* AWS DataSync might help you write the server, but you are writing an Android app.
