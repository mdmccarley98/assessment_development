Multiple Choice

## Stem
What is reflection?

## Answer Key
Reflection is a feature that allows Java to retrieve and modify information and attributes of classes, methods and interfaces at runtime.


## Distractors

### 1.
Reflection is a popular framework for producing immutable "views" of object graphs.

### 2.
Reflection is the process used by JIT (Just In Time) compiler to infer the optimal bytecode to compile to machine code before it is needed.

### 3.
Reflection is a process of replicating data in memory to make it thread-safe.


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information (optional):

* Reflection enables "metaprogramming" at runtime, which is difficult in many compiled languages.
* Using reflection tends to be slow.  Minimize reflective calls in code that requires high performance.
