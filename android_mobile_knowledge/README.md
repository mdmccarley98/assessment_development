# Android Mobile Knowledge - Claims with Content and Item Specifications (WIP)
==============================

The Android Mobile Knowledge quiz assesses a candidate's understanding of the Android ecosystem, including core Android APIs and platform-specific tools. Topics on this quiz contain questions that assess both theoretical and practical knowledge of Android tools, architecture, performance, and troubleshooting.

## Claims

- Claim 1 (lifecycle_components): The candidate can understand the fundamental components of an Android app's lifecycle (includes UI and MVVM architecture)
- Claim 2 (data_management): The candidate can understand how to manage various data sources that feed an Android app experience (databases, networking, caching, asynchronous work, etc.)
- Claim 3 (publishing): The candidate can demonstrate the broad skills necessary to publish an app that leverages the vast capabilities of Android.

## Definition of Scores

- Level 1: The candidate is unfamiliar with native Android development and the related languages and technologies. They are unaware of common UI development tools, Android interface components, or Android performance optimizations, or are missing essential knowledge of Java or Kotlin.
- Level 2: The candidate understands some of the basics of native Android development and Java or Kotlin. They show some familiarity with common UI development tools, Android layouts like LinearLayout, and simple performance optimization strategies. However, they display little or no knowledge of troubleshooting techniques, Android data persistence methods, or the details of the Android OS.
- Level 3: The candidate is comfortable with native Android development and has at least a working knowledge of Java or Kotlin, especially as they relate to Android development. They understand how to use common UI development tools and display a solid foundation in performance profiling and troubleshooting. They show markers of real-world app design experience, but lack the advanced knowledge necessary to fix subtle bugs or squeeze out maximum performance. They are likely able to build simple Android apps on their own, but may make a few design errors.
- Level 4: The candidate is well-versed in native Android development, along with both the underlying theory and practical application of Java/Kotlin and of the Android platform itself. They understand Android data persistence methods, memory management, and performance profiling and troubleshooting, and they are comfortable using a range of UI development tools to create a responsive UI. They may not know all the details of advanced performance optimizations, but can clearly articulate tradeoffs between different libraries and tools. They display the ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical solutions that are close to optimal.
- Level 5: The candidate displays strong theoretical knowledge and practical expertise in Android native development from the simple to the complex. They demonstrate a deep understanding of a wide range of UI development tools, Android data persistence methods, and memory management techniques. They can create highly-performance, responsive Android apps and handle advanced profiling and troubleshooting.
