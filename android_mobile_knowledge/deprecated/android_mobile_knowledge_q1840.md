## Stem
What does an adapter do for a view like a `ListView`?


## Code Snippet (optional)



## Answer Key
An adapter manages data binding and provides child views to the view.


## Distractors
### 1.
An adapter provides recycled views to preserve memory for a view.


### 2.
An adapter changes the style of a view based on the selected theme.


### 3.
An adapter makes the view shrink to fit within the screen bounds.


## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

A RecyclerView.Adapter provides recycled views, but a normal adapter for a ListView will happily use all the memory on the phone even if it's subviews are not visible.
