# C➕➕ Static and Dynamic libs

## Item ID
2517

## Claim
Claim 3

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> Functions are blocks of code that are reusable throughout a program. Using them saves time, removing the need to rewrite code multiple times. Libraries, like functions also save time in that they make functiones reusable in multiple programs.

> Static libraries, while reusable in multiple programs, are locked into a program at compile time. Dynamic, or shared libraries on the other hand, exist as separate files outside of the executable file.

> The downside of using a static library is that it’s code is locked into the final executable file and cannot be modified without a re-compile. In contrast, a dynamic library can be modified without a need to re-compile.

> Because dynamic libraries live outside of the executable file, the program need only make one copy of the library’s files at compile-time. Whereas using a static library means every file in your program must have it’s own copy of the library’s files at compile-time.

## Target Level
Level 2

## Content Target
- Static libraries
- Dynamic libraries

## Cognitive Model
Recall

## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Regarding the compilation process, select the TRUE statement about dynamic and static libraries after linkage.

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Dynamic libraries exist as separate files outside of the executable file

## Distractors

### 1.
Static libraries work just with pieces of code that have static variables

### 2.
While reusable in multiple programs, dynamic libraries are linked to a program at compile time

### 3.
A copy of the dynamic library is created for each application instance

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:

- Distractor 1
    This distractor is only for people who have no clue what is happening on this question. The `static` keyword has another meaning and is not even remotely related to the static library definition.
- Distractor 2
    - Static libraries are locked into a program at compile time.
- Distractor 3
    - A copy of the static library is the one that is created for each application instance.
