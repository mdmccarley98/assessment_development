## Item ID
2496

## Claim
Claim 2

## Claim Behavior (evidence)

## Content Target
- service mesh

## Cognitive Model
Comprehend

## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
An application being developed requires Mutual TLS (mTLS) between each microservice. Which solution is best suited to care for this requirement?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Implement a Service Mesh.

## Distractors
### 1.
Implement an Internal Load Balancer.

### 2.
Implement self-signed TLS certificates within each service.

### 3.
Implement LetsEncrypt.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
1. This will not handle TLS at the service level.
2. This is problematic and error prone.
3. LetsEncrypt does not typically work with internal services.
