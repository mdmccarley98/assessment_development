# Distributed Computing 2: Message Queue


## Item ID
2256

## Claim

-   Claim: 2


## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. Messages are stored on the queue until they are processed and deleted. Each message is processed only once, by a single consumer. Message queues can be used to decouple heavyweight processing, to buffer or batch work, and to smooth spiky workloads.

> A message queue is a component of messaging middleware solutions that enables independent applications and services to exchange information. Message queues store “messages”—packets of data that applications create for other applications to consume—in the order they are transmitted until the consuming application can process them.
