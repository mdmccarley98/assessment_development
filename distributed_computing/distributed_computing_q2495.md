# Distributed Computing 1: Scaling Horizontally

## Item ID
2495

## Claim
Claim 1

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> Horizontal scaling, also called scaling out and in, means adding or removing instances of a resource. The application continues running without interruption as new resources are provisioned. When the provisioning process is complete, the solution is deployed on these additional resources. If demand drops, the additional resources can be shut down cleanly and deallocated.

> A "horizontally scalable" system is one that can increase capacity by adding more computers to the system. This is in contrast to a "vertically scalable" system, which is constrained to running its processes on only one computer; in such systems the only way to increase performance is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster (or more) CPUs, memory or storage.
