> Dead letter queues
> What can your application do if a queue contains a message that you canâ€™t process? Most messaging services allow you to configure a dead-letter queue for messages that you fail to process a certain number of times. This makes it easy to set them aside for further inspection without blocking the queue processing or spending CPU cycles on a message that can never be consumed successfully.

> If the Pub/Sub service attempts to deliver a message but the subscriber can't acknowledge it, Pub/Sub can forward the undeliverable message to a dead-letter topic.
