# Distributed Computing 3: Load Balancing


## Item ID
2081

## Claim

-   Claim: 3

## Threshold Probabilities
[0.30, 0.50, 0.70, 0.80]

## Claim Behavior (evidence)

> A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers
> and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those
> requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures
> that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance. If a single
> server goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online
> servers. When a new server is added to the server group, the load balancer
> automatically starts to send requests to it.
