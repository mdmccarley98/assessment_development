# Distributed Computing 2: Pub-Sub

## Item ID
2461

## Claim
Claim 2

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
> Requires a well-defined policy for message formatting and message exchange; otherwise, message consumption can become mangled and error-prone.
> https://www.redhat.com/architect/pub-sub-pros-and-cons

> Pub/Sub makes discovery of services easier, more natural and less error prone. Instead of maintaining a roster of peers that an application can send messages to, a publisher will simply post messages to a topic.

> Pub/Sub makes software more flexible. Publishers and subscribers are decoupled and work independently from each other, which allows you to develop and scale them independently.
