## Stem
For security, browsers enforce the "Same-origin policy".  Suppose your script is served from:
`https://app.example.com/index.js`

In modern browsers, which of the following URLs are considered to have the same origin?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
`https://app.example.com/static/imgs/icon.png`

## Distractors
### 1.
`https://example.com/index.html`

### 2.
`http://app.example.com/users/sally`

### 3.
`https://app.example.com:591/index.js`

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
* Differences in protocol, subdomain, and port are all treated as different origins.
* IE is not considered a "modern browser".  It would also accept distractor three as the same origin.
