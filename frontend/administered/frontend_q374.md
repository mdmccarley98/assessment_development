## Stem
When browsers don't support a new feature, developers turn to polyfills. How do these work?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
A polyfill implements an API so that developers can build against a consistent interface, even on unsupported browsers.

## Distractors

### 1.
A polyfill sets flags on the browser's runtime that enable experimental features that aren't on the stable channel yet.

### 2.
A polyfill is a wrapper around a lightweight version of the V8 runtime, which contains working implementations for HTML5 features.

### 3.
A polyfill replaces the CSS engine on a page to support new CSS3 features like animations and flexbox.
