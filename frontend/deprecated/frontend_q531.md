## Stem
Which of the following statements is NOT true about React lifecycle methods?


## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Usage of the shouldComponentUpdate method is considered an anti-pattern.

## Distractors

### 1.
Functional components have no access to lifecycle methods

### 2.
If a render method triggers an asynchronous action which has a callback that in turn results in a state change for the component, it will trigger an infinite rendering loop.

### 3.
* For a given component class within the scope of an app's lifecycle, the componentWillMount method will typically be called a number of times that is greater than or equal to the number of times the class constructor is called.
