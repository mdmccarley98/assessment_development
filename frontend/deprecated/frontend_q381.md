## Stem
Why does the following quirk appear in Javascript?

## Code Snippet (optional)
```javascript
console.log(.1 + .2) //0.30000000000000004
```

## Answer Key
This is an inherent limitation of floating-point arithmetic that Javascript shares with many other languages.

## Distractors

### 1.
The IEEE 754 standard would handle this arithmetic properly, but Javascript does not use it for storing floating point numbers.

### 2.
Javascript's built-in numbers are limited to 32 bits of precision.

### 3.
Javascript stores numbers in hexadecimal format, which is incapable of rendering some decimal values precisely.
