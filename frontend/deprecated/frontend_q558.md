## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Async/await is syntactic sugar for Promises that allows you to write synchronous-looking callback code

## Distractors

### 1.
Promises are an implementation of the Observer pattern, while async/await bypasses the Javascript event loop

### 2.
Async/await offloads work to an additional CPU thread, while Promises are syntactic sugar for callbacks

### 3.
Promises can throw errors, but async/await always fails silently
