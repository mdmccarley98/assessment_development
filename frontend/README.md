# Frontend - Claims with Content and Item Specifications (WIP)
The Frontend quiz assesses a candidate's understanding of web development within a web page loaded in a user's browser. Topics on this quiz contain questions that assess both theoretical knowledge and practical use of front-end technologies, especially JavaScript and major JavaScript libraries, CSS, and HTTP.

## Claims

- **Claim 1 (responsive_ui):** The candidate can demonstrate the ability to construct responsive, well structured web application user interfaces. (Includes structure and UI)
- **Claim 2 (data):** The candidate can fetch and manipulate data asynchronously from various data sources.
- **Claim 3 (performance_and_security):** The candidate can demonstrate knowledge of best practices for optimizing network performance, browser experience and how to properly secure web applications.

## Definitions of Scores
- **Level 1:** The candidate has an incomplete understanding of modern front-end technologies and likely needs guidance in using them effectively. They have some familiarity with how Javascript handles events and modern Javascript practices like immutable data structures and functional programming, but it is not extensive. They are lacking in foundational CSS knowledge like specificity. They may not understand networking semantics like HTTP verbs and network security.
- **Level 2:** The candidate has a basic understanding of modern front-end technologies and is capable of accomplishing small tasks with some direction. The candidate has some familiarity of concepts like promises, immutability, and event handling. They likely understand fundamentals of CSS and can make HTTP requests but may not grasp the intimate details or tradeoffs between different approaches.
- **Level 3:** The candidate has a working knowledge of modern front-end technologies and is capable of building straightforward applications with little guidance. They exhibit a functional understanding of Javascript concepts like asynchronous programming and event handling. They are comfortable with HTTP semantics and modern CSS fundamentals. Their approaches may not be the most efficient, but they are likely to be technically sound.
- **Level 4:** The candidate is comfortable and well-versed in modern front-end technologies. They are likely capable of building relatively complex applications independently. They demonstrate an understanding of core Javascript nuances like the event loop. They have a good knowledge of CSS constructs like specificity and are capable of making tradeoffs between approaches like flex and grid. They demonstrate the ability to make HTTP requests and understand how to secure them properly.
- **Level 5:** The candidate displays strong theoretical and practical knowledge of modern front-end technologies, from the simple to the complex. They demonstrate a deep understanding of how JavaScript, CSS, and HTTP requests work under the hood and an excellent ability to reason through the tradeoffs between different implementations. They are well-versed in JavaScript, and at least one major framework like React or Angular, and they can handle advanced troubleshooting and performance optimization projects.
