# Algorithmic Knowledge - Claims with Content and Item Specifications (WIP)
==============================

The Algorithmic Knowledge quiz assesses a candidate's understanding of classic algorithms and data structures, a common
subject in four-year CS programs, and a fundamental skill in software and data engineering. Topics on this quiz contain
questions that range from simple definitions and use cases, and progress through the details of more obscure data
structures and algorithms, including their concrete implementations and practical application.

## Claims

- Claim 1: Algorithms
- Claim 2: Data Structures

## Skill Level Definitions

- Level 1: The candidate displays little to no knowledge of algorithms. They might recognize some crude data structures
  such as arrays, graphs, and trees, but would struggle to discern their underlying structure, properties, application, or
  implementation details.

- Level 2: The candidate displays basic familiarity with data structures and their subtypes, e.g., binary trees and
  directed graphs, but has difficulty understanding their application and implementation details. They might be familiar
  with some classic algorithms, but might not be able to understand or derive their computational complexity, or reason 
  about their trade-offs and use-cases.

- Level 3: The candidate is able to recognize a broad range of data structures, including linked lists, hash maps,
  stacks, queues, binary search trees, weighted graphs, etc. They are able to perform standard operations on these data
  structures, derive their computational complexity, and use them to construct algorithms to solve commonly occuring
  problems. They are likely to struggle with advanced algorithm design and optimization techniques, but are expected to
  have a well-rounded understanding of basic algorithms and their application.

- Level 4: The candidate displays sound knowledge of CS fundamentals. They can comfortably define advanced data
  structures, implement efficient algorithms, and understand worst-, average-, and best-case time and space
  complexities. They have a solid grasp of the different approaches for designing and optimizing algorithms and 
  can understand their practical application. They might not always recognize or arrive at the most optimal solution,
  but their algorithmic foundation is solid.

- Level 5: The candidate displays an extremely comprehensive understanding of both basic and advanced data structures.
  They are knowledgeable when it comes to complex algorithm design, optimization, and computational geometry concepts,
  and they demonstrate excellent algorithmic problem-solving abilities.
