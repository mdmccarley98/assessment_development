## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Which of the following is NOT true of doubly linked lists?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
A node can only have one null pointer

## Distractors
### 1.
Both the head and the tail have a null pointer

### 2.
Each node, except the head, has a pointer to its predecessor

### 3.
Each node has two pointers

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- In a doubly linked list, each node has two pointers, one to its predecessor (or null) and another to its successor (or null).
- A node without a predecessor is called a head, while a node without a successor is called a tail.
- When a node has neither a predecessor nor a successor, it is both the head and the tail of that list, and as such has two null pointers.
