## Stem
Which graph algorithm do build tools like CMake and Maven use to efficiently determine the order in which to build source code dependencies?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
They use a topological sort to ensure a valid build order.

## Distractors

### 1.
They use a minimum spanning tree algorithm to minimize the number of compilations required to build the target.

### 2.
They use a max-flow algorithm like Ford-Fulkerson to determine the build order and identify subsets of the graph that can run on multiple threads.

### 3.
They use an iterative deepening search to quickly build a linear ordering of the graph in `O(n)` time.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
NA
