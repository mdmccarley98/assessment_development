## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
In complexity analysis, which of the following is used to describe an asymptotically tight bound?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Big Theta (Big-θ)

## Distractors
### 1.
Big Oh (Big-O)

### 2.
Little Oh (Little-o)

### 3.
Big Omega (Big-Ω)

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
* Big-O denotes an upper bound that is not asymptotically tight.
* Little-o denotes an upper bound that is stricter than Big-O but is not asymptotically tight.
* Big-Ω denotes a lower bound that is not asymptotically tight.
