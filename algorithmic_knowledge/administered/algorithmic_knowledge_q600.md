## Stem
You have an array of values.  Some values occur more than one time in the array.
You write a method that outputs the value with the most duplicates, and updates its internal data structure.

For example, given the array of values ["a", "b", "a"] the count of "a" is 2, and the count of "b" is 1.  The method first returns "a", then "a" again, and finally "b".

Which data structure would be most efficient (asymptotically) to track such an association of values and counts?
