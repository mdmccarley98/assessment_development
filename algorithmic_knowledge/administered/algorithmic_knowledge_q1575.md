# Handling Negative Edge Weights

## Item ID
1575

## Claim
1: algorithms

## Target Skill Level
4

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
[Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)

## Content Target
Shortest Path

## Cognitive Model
Comprehend

## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Which of these shortest-path algorithms may be applicable for a graph that has edges with negative weights?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
The Bellman-Ford algorithm

## Distractors
### 1.
Dijkstra's algorithm

### 2.
The A* algorithm

### 3.
Dial's algorithm

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
* Dial's algorithm is just a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
* Bellman-Ford can also be used to determine whether there are any negative cycles in the graph.
