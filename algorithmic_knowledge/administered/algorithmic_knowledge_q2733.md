Multiple Choice

## Stem
Given a full binary tree of an algebraic expression, which technique can be used to derive its standard Polish notation representation?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Pre-order traversal

## Distractors
### 1.
In-order traversal

### 2.
Post-order traversal

### 3.
Level-order traversal

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
In Polish notation (aka Polish prefix notation), the operator is located before the operands: + x y. For instance, the expression `(2 + 3) * 5` would be written as: `* + 2 3`. Consequently, traversing a binary tree of an algebraic expression with the pre-order technique will yield its Polish notation representation.
