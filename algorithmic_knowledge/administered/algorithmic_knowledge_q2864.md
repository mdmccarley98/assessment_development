## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Which techniques can be used to perform depth-first search and bread-first search on a ternary tree?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Preorder and level-order traversals respectively

## Distractors
### 1.
Preorder and inorder traversals respectively

### 2.
Successive left-right and right-left tree rotations respectively

### 3.
Depth-first search and bread-first search can not be performed on ternary trees

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Since trees are actually connected acyclic graphs, DFS and BFS can both be performed on them as well.
- DFS translates to either the preorder, inorder, or postorder traversal, while BFS translates to the level-order traversal. 
- Tree rotation is a technique used for modifying the structure of a tree but not for searching.
