## Claim
1: algorithms

## Target Skill Level
3

## Claim Behavior (evidence)
[NP-completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness)

## Content Target
Computational Complexity

## Cognitive Model
Recall, Comprehend

## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Complete the following sentence: "NP-complete problems are ________________"

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
solvable, and their solutions are verifiable in polynomial time.

## Distractors
### 1.
NP-hard problems that are NOT in NP.

### 2.
unsolvable, but their solutions can often be approximated.

### 3.
harder than the hardest NP-hard problems.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
* NP-hard problems are not necessarily in NP, but *every* NP-Complete problem is in both NP-Hard and NP.
* NP-Complete problems are solvable, by definition.
* NP-Complete problems are not *harder* than NP-Hard.  They are a subset of NP-Hard.
* The relationships are easy to draw as a Venn diagram but are a little difficult to describe.  So there are often misconceptions that arise from reading simplistic descriptions.
