## Stem
What's different between the asymptotic bounds specified by  Big-O and Little-o complexity classes? 



## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
Big-O specifies an inclusive upper bound, Little-o specifies a strict upper bound

## Distractors

### 1.
Big-O specifies a strict upper bound, Little-o specifies a strict lower bound

### 2.
Big-O specifies a worst-case bound on complexity, while Little-o is a best-case bound

### 3.
Big-O specific a loose upper bound, while Little-o is asymptotically tight

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
