## Item Type
Multiple Choice

## Stem
Which of the following sorting algorithms has the slowest worst-case running time?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Quicksort

## Distractors
### 1.
Mergesort

### 2.
Heapsort

### 3.
They all have the same worst-case running time.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
* Mergesort and Heapsort have identical worst-case running times, O(_n_ log _n_).
* Quicksort has an unlikely worst-case scenario that is pretty slow, i.e. O(_n_<sup>2</sup>), when every pivot chosen is either the smallest or the largest value in its partition.
