## Stem
How many topologically distinct binary trees are there with 6 nodes?
<br><br>
E.g. There are 5 topologically distinct binary trees with 3 nodes.

```
    •           •           •           •           •           
   / \         /           /             \           \
  •   •       •           •               •           •
             /             \             /             \
            •               •           •               •

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
132

## Distractors
### 1.
10

### 2.
11

### 3.
719

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- 132 is the number of topologically distinct binary trees with 6 nodes
- 10 is twice the number of topologically distinct binary trees with 3 nodes
- 11 is the number of structurally distinct (unordered) binary trees with 6 nodes
- 719 is the number of total permutations of 6 different nodes (6!) less one (works for the example; `3!-1=5`)
