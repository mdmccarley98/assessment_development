## Stem
What is a major benefit of using recursion over iteration?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Recursion brings clarity, simplicity, and efficiency in designing and implementing algorithms for problems with repetitive, self-referential structures.

## Distractors
### 1.
Recursion tends to be much more efficient than iteration in terms of memory utilization.

### 2.
Recursive algorithms require a clearly defined base case that guarantees their Turing completeness.

### 3.
Recursive algorithms are generally much faster than their unoptimized iterative counterparts.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- Recursive algorithms tend to be less memory- or space-efficient as they maintain a stack of data values in memory.
- Iterative algorithms tend to have similar or better time complexity compared to recursive algorithms, and they are easier to optimize.
- Recursive algorithms require a base case, but this neither guarantees they will halt nor says anything else about their turing completeness.
- Recursive algorithms are mainly preferred for problems that can be reasoned about and solved via recursion, 
  particularly when their computational complexity can be optimized to yield similar or better results than iterative analogues.
