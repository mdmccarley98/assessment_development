## Stem
When parsing an arithmetic expression from a syntax tree in reverse Polish notation, what is omitted from the original expression?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
Brackets

## Distractors
### 1.
Equality sign

### 2.
Fractions

### 3.
Exponentiation symbols

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
In reverse Polish notation (aka Polish postfix notation), the operator is located after the operands: x y +. For instance, the expression `(2 + 3) * 5` would be written as: `2 3 + 5 *` and `2 + (3 * 5)` would be written as `2 3 5 * +`. Consequently, there is no need to use parentheses, as there is no longer any ambiguity on how to match the operands to the operators.
