Multiple Choice

## Stem
A non-circular linked list is topologically and operationally identical to which of the following
data structures?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
A degenerate tree

## Distractors
### 1.
A full binary tree

### 2.
A directed bipartite graph

### 3.
A quasi-transitive digraph

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
- A linked list without a circular reference is identical to a degenerate (rooted) tree which has a 
  single leaf node and every other node has only one child node.
  
- A full binary tree maintains a pair of pointers for each node, i.e., every non-leaf node connects 
  to both a left and a right child node.
  
- A directed graph, as a generic structure, can be reduced to a degenerate tree and in that way take
  the form of a linked list. However, both bipartite and quasi-transitive digraphs have additional 
  properties that prevent them from ever assuming a linear linked list structure.
