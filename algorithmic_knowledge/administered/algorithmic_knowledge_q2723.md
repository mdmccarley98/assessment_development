## Stem
Given an array of items that may contain duplicates, the task is to output unique items. Which of the following statements is NOT correct about the possible solution implementation?

## Code Snippet (optional)

## Answer Key
You will need to insert the elements in a heap, which will take O(n) time.

## Distractors
### 1.
You will need to create a hash set and insert the array elements one by one, with an O(n) total time.

### 2.
You will need to iterate over each element in an array in a sorted fashion, with an O(n log n) time.

### 3.
You will need to insert each element in an unsorted array and sequentially scan for each item resulting in O(n^2) total time.

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
