## Stem
What's one advantage that a dynamic array has over a linked list?

## Code Snippet (optional)


## Answer Key
The binary search algorithm can run over a (sorted) array list, but can't run over a linked list.

## Distractors

### 1.
An array list allows fast (constant time) inserts, while a linked list takes linear time.

### 2.
A linked list is actually superior to an array list, but it's harder to implement correctly. In most cases, a dynamic array is sufficient.

### 3.
Dynamic arrays work better in concurrent environments. Rather than locking every node, you only need to lock the single list.
