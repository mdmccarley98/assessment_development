## Stem
Given a set of words, the task is to find anagrams.

Anagrams are words that have the same letters but in different orders.
For example "save" and "vase" are anagrams. They contain the same letters, but the order of the letters is different.
The word "eaves" is NOT an anagram of "save" because it has an extra "e".

Which approach would be most efficient?
