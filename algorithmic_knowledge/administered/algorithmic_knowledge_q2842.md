125

### 3.
126

## Common errors, misconceptions, or irrelevant information:
The formula for obtaining the height of a complete binary tree is ⌊log<sub>2</sub>(n)⌋ or ⌈log<sub>2</sub>(n+1)⌉−1. Note that either the floor or the ceiling of log<sub>2</sub>n has to be considered, depending on which formula is being used. Failing to do so, or mixing them up, can result in an erroneous calculation.

A binary tree with 126 nodes can have a height of 125, but only if it is degenerate and not complete.

A tree with 126 nodes and height 126 does not exist.
