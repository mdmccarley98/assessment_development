# Security Engineering - Claims with Content and Item Specifications (WIP)
==============================

The Security Engineering quiz assesses a candidate's understanding of how to identify threats and vulnerabilities in systems and software, then use these skills in developing and implementing solutions to defend against hacking, malware and ransomware and all types of malicious activity.

# Claims - Performance Indicators
==============================

-   Claim/PI 1: The candidate is unfamiliar with security engineering. They are unaware of common security tools and methodologies and are missing essential knowledge of modern web application security measures.

-   Claim/PI 2: The candidate understands some of the basics of security. They show some familiarity with common tools and methodologies. However, they lack the knowledge to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

-   Claim/PI 3: The candidate is comfortable in a security focused position. They show a working knowledge of common tools and methodologies and possess the basic skills needed to perform penetration tests using automated tools.

-   Claim/PI 4: The candidate is well-versed in security engineering. They show an understanding of the causes behind security issues. They are able to not only identify but also remediate threats. They possess the skills needed to perform in-depth penetration tests.

-   Claim/PI 5: The candidate displays strong theoretical knowledge and practical expertise. They are likely able to explain and provide remediation guidance to developers and management. They are well-versed with standards and practices and could potentially provide guidance at an organizational level.
