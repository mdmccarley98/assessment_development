## Claim Behavior (evidence)

>The CIA Triad is a benchmark model in information security designed to govern and evaluate how an organization handles data when it is stored, transmitted, or processed. Each attribute of the triad represents a critical component of information security:

>Confidentiality – Data should not be accessed or read without authorization. It ensures that only authorized parties have access. Attacks against Confidentiality are disclosure attacks.

>Integrity – Data should not be modified or compromised in anyway. It assumes that data remains in its intended state and can only be edited by authorized parties. Attacks against Integrity are alteration attacks.

>Availability – Data should be accessible upon legitimate request. It ensures that authorized parties have unimpeded access to data when required. Attacks against Availability are destruction attacks.
